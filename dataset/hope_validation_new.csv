0,102_0,T,"Now, one thing I thought we might do today is to get an example of one of these situations in which you get really anxious. And try to see if we can understand more about how you think and how you feel when you're in the middle of one of those situations. So can you think of an example of something that's happened recently? ",irq,,
1,102_1,P,"My daughter has been, she's actually been sick. And so she had a fever yesterday and they started her on an antibiotic and I had to go pick it up from the drugstore, and that's like, I don't usually go there. It's hard to get there. Like it's not right in the neighborhood. So any expressways or bridges to get there, not expressways, but It's busy, it's busier and attracting a mall. So you know, there are six lanes four lanes. Yeah. So it just, it's not someplace I usually would go. And if I was going to go, usually I would either have her go with me or my husband go with me, but she was sick and he was at work. And",id,,
2,102_2,T,"so to try to understand what goes through your mind that's trying to take you back. And now you know that the prescriptions there and your daughter's sick and I guess you don't want to ask her to drive over there. I sorted Yeah, probably not the wisest idea. So you're thinking about doing the drive and what's going through your mind? What are the thoughts that are turning inside?",orq,,
3,102_3,P,"I'm just, you know, I'm sort of thinking about going there. And I'm already starting to think well, you know, what, what if you know what if, what if I'm driving and somebody crashes into me What if I'm driving and I can't do it? You know, what if I just have to stop because I can't do it anymore and, you know, it was raining and I'm sort of like, I've got this picture of myself like out in the middle of the road and you know, what's the picture look like? You're out in the middle of the road and stranded and it's dark and my you know, you know, my shoes are gone. I'm just like, it's like I it would be a million miles to get back home. pretty miserable.",od,,
4,102_4,T,Yeah. Yeah. Pretty scary.,ack,,
5,102_5,P,"Oh, terrifying. Yeah. And I just it's so hard to get there.",id,,
6,102_6,T,And Kate as you as you put yourself back into that situation and have those thoughts going through your mind. What kinds of feelings go along with it? ,orq,,
7,102_7,P,"My feelings I mean it things are inside like ago anxiety, physical things are going on. Well fear and anxiety and I just feel really shaky and I feel really like lightheaded and dizzy and I just don't feel like I can breathe very well and",od,,
8,102_8,T,It's just a panic attack now? He told me about having some bad ones.,id,,
9,102_9,P,but it's getting there not quite to a panic.,id,,
10,102_10,T,"Yeah, no, it's brewing.",gc,,
11,102_11,P,"Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it feels like it might. Yeah,",gc,,
12,102_12,T,"yeah. What do you think we might do to try to, to move things along toward getting a plan of attack on this, okay, is to actually sketch this out. Okay, and, and then see if we can figure out some things we might be able to start doing to give you a better handle on that you have right now. Okay. So let's put some boxes here. And one of them is going to be event these are the things that trigger your anxiety. In this case, the event was",irq,,
13,102_13,P,"the driver having to drive to the, to the pharmacy,",id,,
14,102_14,T,"drive to pharmacy. And then this next box, I'm gonna label something we call automatic thoughts. And but automatic, I mean that they occur relatively automatically, they just sort of pop into your mind, and you don't stop to check them out. Okay, and we all have these kinds of automatic thoughts. You don't have them, everybody I know has them their inner thoughts. In fact, if you think about it for a minute, we probably have a lot more thoughts. We don't speak out loud, that are part of our inner dialogue and thoughts, we actually end up speaking aloud other people. Mm hmm. And I suspect that you have lots of those thoughts and just give me some examples of them. So that's what we call an automatic.",id,,
15,102_15,P,So the like the what ifs?,crq,,
16,102_16,T,"Yeah, so let's put a couple of those down in this box. Okay, in the automatic slot box, and they are what if",cd,,
17,102_17,P,someone runs into me.,id,,
18,102_18,T,Yeah. What if What else?,irq,,
19,102_19,P,What if I get stranded?,gc,,
20,102_20,T,get stranded.,gc,,
21,102_21,P,I can't do it.,gc,,
22,102_22,T,I can't do it. And then there was this image about the rainstorm and you don't have any shoes on. Yeah. so forth. What should we put down for that?,irq,,
23,102_23,P,I think what if I would if I can't get back home? I can't get back on.,id,,
24,102_24,T,sort of lost. Yeah.,ack,,
25,102_25,P,Yeah. What if I end up on this road forever?,irq,,
26,102_26,T,"Mm hmm. And then we're going to put another box there's a sort of a chain of events here. The event can make you think in ways that stir up feelings of anxiety. And so if you're thinking like this, it makes sense that you'd be feeling pretty nervous inside and you might have some of these physical reactions. Mm hmm. So let's put those in here. This is the emotion sparks They are much shaky. You said? Yeah. Quite a fear. Yeah. If we're going to write that fear on a zero to 100, scale and zeros, none at all and 100 is the maximum anyone could ever get. Where would you be at this point?",ack,,
27,102_27,P,"Oh, I'd say about an AD",id,,
28,102_28,T,"AD pretty high. Yeah. It's gotten higher though, I suspect. Oh, yeah. This point is in 18. Okay. And then you had some other feelings inside?",id,,
29,102_29,P,"Well, I yeah. I sort of felt like I might fall over. I, my heart was pounding and I didn't feel like I can",id,,
30,102_30,T,"breathe. Stomach any lobster. So yeah. So a lot going on here. Yeah. And a pretty high level of distress. Yes, right. And then we're going to complete this loop. Putting a box we're gonna call behavior. This is how you actually acted when you're in the situation. So what did you do? If you had these thoughts and you had these feelings,",id,,
31,102_31,P,I went to the pharmacy. He did do it. I had to okay.,gc,,
32,102_32,T,And what was it like for you when you were going to the pharmacy and driving there?,irq,,
33,102_33,P,"It was so bad. I just, you know, I, I think I left permanent marks on the steering wheel, because I was whole time.",id,,
34,102_34,T,"Okay, yeah. So in this case, she actually did go to the pharmacy. That year, maybe it isn't damage to the steering wheels. Yeah. Yeah, I hope not.",id,,
35,102_35,P,"But I really had no choice. I mean, I think usually I wouldn't go to the pharmacy. Usually. I would call my husband and say can you pick it up on your way home, get",id,,
36,102_36,T,"an escape route, if you would?  So usually you would avoid this if we looked at this as a model. For many of these situations about driving and feeling, yes, the usual behavior would be to try to get out of it or avoid it. Okay? And so if you do avoid it, then what happens?",irq,,
37,102_37,P,"Well, I feel better. You feel better. It's like such a relief.",id,,
38,102_38,T,"Better relief, the emotions calm down now, right?",crq,,
39,102_39,P,"Well, yeah, cuz I don't have to, like,",cd,,
40,102_40,T,"You don't have to worry about it. So that's what happens for a single episode of this anxiety. I'm wondering though, if we look at the the impact on you of avoiding and getting relief, overall, as far as managing driving, what do you think it does there?",id,,
41,102_41,P,"Well, I feel like I don't really have much confidence when it comes to this to be able to do",od,,
42,102_42,T,"it. Okay. So in a way, it decreases your confidence over time. I think so. Yeah. I think suspect that that not doing it repeatedly gives you this belief about your capacity to do these driving things. And what's that belief? Yeah,",irq,,
43,102_43,P,I don't feel like I can do I can't I can't do it.,id,,
44,102_44,T,"I can't do it. So it really comes back to this thought I can't do it. Yeah. And he can't do it. You don't do it. Right. So here's this, this chain of events, events, trigger thoughts. We call them automatic thoughts, and then they influence your emotions. He's feelings you have and then that influences how you handle the situation. Mm hmm. Okay. Now let's think together for a moment before we wrap up of how we might proceed to try to give you some help with this. So let's take a look at these thoughts. Do you know anybody else that drives regularly that might think differently than you? Yeah, okay. I mean, an example.",id,,
45,102_45,P,"I mean, I think almost everybody, I think most people drive without too much. problem but like, my sister loves to drive. Yeah, I mean, she just she drives every opportunity she gets.",id,,
46,102_46,T,"So for some reason, we don't know exactly why. But the key thing here is not looking at why but to help you with actually making change in this. But you do have some differences in the way you think about driving. That might be something that we could begin to work on in our session, we might, for example, check it out, what's the chances of someone slamming into you? Okay, what's the chances of you being stranded out there on highway and even if you were stranded, is there a way you could cope with that or manage that you can get back home? So these are some things that we can begin to do. So I'm going to mark here, we could work on these thoughts, okay. And then by working on the thoughts, we might be able to help you reduce the emotions, but there are also some things that I might be able to teach you that you could use to reduce this level of distress that you have that Would be nice to be able to calm yourself down in situations. So we'll have some, try to build some skills to manage your emotions. And then on this behavior side, one thing that we might begin to work on is helping you gradually begin to take on some of these driving things so that you can build your confidence back up. And again, build your skills to do it. And I can see that that causes a little bit of edginess here, what would you think? ",orq,,
47,102_47,P,"I was thinking that I hope that this doesn't like make me worse. Okay, no, like, trying to do some of these things.",od,,
48,102_48,T,"Well, I'm glad you gave me that feedback. That's an example by the way of me wanting to hear from you about the way you're responding to what I'm saying. I certainly wouldn't want to make it worse. Okay, but it cause you too much anxiety. Uh huh. And what we'll try to do is pace it adjust to the level that's right for you. Okay, so that you can make some progress and get to the place you want to be, which is to be able to drive to your new office, cross a bridge, and maybe even, you know, drive those couple hours to visit your son. Right. Yeah. So what do you think?",id,,
49,102_49,P,"Well, I think that that would if I could do those things that would be really nice. Yeah,",id,,
50,102_50,T,that could be really nice too. So that would be our goal. Yeah.,id,,
51,116_0,T,"Hi, Heidi, my name is Dr. Sarah. I'm one of the emergency doctors. I'd like to have a chat with you about what's been going On how you've been feeling so we can find out how best to help you. Would that be alright? ",yq,,
52,116_1,P,"Yeah, ",op,,
53,116_2,T,"thanks. So everything we talk about will be confidential unless I think that you're at risk of being seriously harmed or someone else's, or they are being seriously harmed. In that case, I'd need to tell someone so we could make sure that person is safe. Is that okay?",yq,,
54,116_3,P,"Yeah, that's okay.",op,,

160,133_0,T,Has it made you rethink your entire job in the profession?,id,,
161,133_1,P,"Yeah, I mean, it's making me think like, you know, if I just had some desk job, like if I just crunched numbers or something, I would never have to have this responsibility. Like, why would they trust me with a job like this? Like, I'm just a human being who, you know, doesn't know any better than any other person and I just don't know if I can do this. It's just so much responsible. And I guess, I guess before I felt like I could handle it. And now I just feel like it's so much responsibility for one person.

165,133_5,P,"I feel like it's just around the corner. And this isn't even resolved. I'm still afraid of the consequences of this, you know, like, what if, you know, you know, these kids are out of their parents home. And I just feel like what if something bad happens to them where they are now and then that's going to fall on me and, you know, people, like other my co workers know that I'm the one that did this. So like, if something happens to the kids, like, I'm going to be the one that they're going to blame for it.",id,,
166,133_6,T,"So just to make sure, I understand your Report. So they were engaging in these behaviors. And your report, just what precipitated the them being broken up.",id,,
167,133_7,P,"Yeah. Because, you know, before that, I guess, you know, probably nobody else would have known about it. So I made the report about what was going on. And I think Yeah, as a direct result.",ack,,
168,133_8,T,"Alright, let's, let's take a look at the habits, right. So, in CBT, we like to evaluate evidence and try to look at the facts as we understand them. And really, we want to scrutinize and carefully review the facts and the evidence and hold a light to it and try to figure out what's going on. Right. What would have happened with this family if you hadn't work, no one intervened?",id,,
169,133_9,P,"I don't know. I mean, it wasn't going great for the kids. It wasn't really great environment. But I just feel like if I had left it alone, I don't know that the kids would be with their parents.",id,,
170,133_10,T,"So they all be together. And you feel like, right now. He's saying with them being a part. That sounds good. Is that fair together?",irq,,
171,133_11,P,"Yeah, I mean, I guess. I guess I feel like it's probably wasn't great for them to be there. I mean, that's why I made the report. That's my job, but it just feels like, you know, I just feels like I'm playing God. You know what I mean? Like, I'm just coming in here and spend like 5-10 minutes with a family and then totally turn their whole world upside down.",id,,
172,133_12,T,"you have a tremendous amount of power And if you misuse that power, you could devastate families. That's maybe what you You think happened to you? ",crq,,
173,133_13,P,Yeah.,op,,
174,133_14,T," So going back to what would have happened to them, let me just step back there for a moment. They would still be together without your intervention. And that could be a positive. What about consequences that maybe were negative?",id,,
175,133_15,P,"Well, I mean, like I said, I thought they were using drugs in the home. So that's like a really dangerous situation for kids to be in, because you don't know what kind of people are coming in and out of the home, if their parents are going to be, you know, coherent enough to help them if there's an emergency or if the parents are even making them food and taking care of their needs and stuff like that. So I guess in that sense, that's really concerning. And that's a big part of the reason why I made the report.",id,,
176,133_16,T,"You made the report because it's your responsibility, but also you had concerns about their welfare. If you could go back and do it again. would you change anything?",id,,
177,133_17,P,"I don't know. I guess that's just the hardest part for me is like, I feel like I can't make the right decision. I just feel like I don't know if I'm equipped to be the person to make that kind of decision.",id,,
178,133_18,T,"So you don't know if you made a good decision or not. And further, you question your ability going forward to make decisions. ",crq,,
179,133_19,P,"Yeah, definitely. That's the uncertainty, anxiety.",ack,,
180,148_0,T,Hi Kylie. How you doing today?,gt,,
181,148_1,P,"Umm I'm doing okay, I guess. Umm I guess something happened over this past week. I have been looking for a new job since I left my last one. And I found I found this really good job on the internet. But the problem is that the job is working with kids and they they have to do a drug test in order for me to get the job. And it kinda like it made me think it made me think a little bit more about something that I've been considering for a while which is kind of just given up, given up we'd forget like it I'm thinking about it for a while. But okay, I also kind of think about the way the way we'd really helps me and like, if I'm ever feeling like really, really anxious about something I mean, we kind of have to chill out and hope to relax and I just don't know if I'm ready to give that up yet.",gt, id,
182,148_2,T,So the marijuana has real value for you that you don't want to see going.,yq,,
183,148_3,P,"Yeah, it does. It's a it's a good way to self medicate in a way",op,,
184,148_4,T,"and at the same time, you would like this job. ",crq,,
185,148_5,P,Yeah.,cd,,
186,148_6,T,"So I could see how this would be you know, a pincher.",crq,,
187,148_7,P,"right. Yeah, it's I mean, it's kind of like it's put me in a difficult spot like I definitely I definitely want to get that job but you know, if I cut it if I cut out smoking like, I don't know what else I would do, like if I if I started to have a panic attack or if if I was really like anxious about Like anything that I'm worrying about, like i don't i don't know what i did copes.",cd, id,
188,148_8,T,Have you been treated for anxiety before?,yq,,
189,148_9,P,"Um, I did therapy for a little bit, but it was like, I don't know, back then it was kind of like when the anxiety was just starting, so it wasn't too big of a problem. So I like I quit there because it wasn't really doing that much. Yeah.",op,,
190,148_10,T,You take the marijuana for any other reason other than to help with the anxiety.,crq,,
191,148_11,P,"I mean, like, if I'm bored or maybe if I'm like hanging out with buddies, like, I don't really have a reason not to do it. I can tell now, but it wasn't like, like, I really use it whenever I'm like feeling really anxious about something.",cd, id,
192,148_12,T,"So and you may not be able to answer this question, but if you didn't have any anxiety would that change your motivation to use marijuana?",crq,,
193,148_13,P,If I didn't have like any kind of anxiety?,crq,,
194,148_14,T,Hmm,cd,,
195,148_15,P,"Umm like it was so be kind of tough to give up. Because like, if I'm hanging out with my buddies and they offer it to me like that's that's always pretty chill but I don't like I really I'm really looking forward to this job and like the benefits of having that job without weighing the benefits of just like smoking smoking with my buddies so",cd, id,
196,148_16,T,so you're excited about the job?,crq,,
197,148_17,P,"I am? Yeah, it's it's almost kind of a dream job.",cd,,
198,148_18,T,really tell me about?,irq,,
199,148_19,P,"Well, it's working with it's working with kids with autism in the school. So like, I would be kind of like, almost like a personal TA in a way. So like, it's part of an inclusion program. So when the kids are going into the class, like I would either sit with them or like maybe back behind the class and kind of like help them out in case something comes up. And it's just my brother has autism that's like it's that's something that I've always really kind of wanted to work with.",id,,
200,148_20,T,So it sounds like your real passion for this type of work.,crq,,
201,148_21,P,Hmm,cd,,
202,148_22,T,"And really, the big obstacle here is this marijuana?",irq,,
203,148_23,P,"It is it's like a catch 22 because it's like, I know the job will be great, but it's like it's a it's a big step for me to take that job. And it's, it's gonna be super umm It's gonna make me super anxious. You know, it's gonna be like, it's gonna be a lot of anxiety taking a new job. So it's like, if I have to give up the marijuana and then like, not have another way to cope with anxiety, like to get the job. It's like a catch 22",id,,
204,148_24,T,"Yeah, it's a predicament. You're kind of weighing both sides of this right. Now. I'm wondering. Do you have Do you think you'd have like a physical craving for the marijuana?",yq,,
205,148_25,P,"No  I mean, not really No.",on,,
206,148_26,T,So you're really using it recreationally and as an anti anxiety agent?,crq,,
207,148_27,P,"Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.",cd,,
208,148_28,T,"So if you were I know you didn't have great success before therapy, to combat anxiety, but if you were being treated for anxiety and working that job, which seems like you would really like do you think you'd be able to stay with the marijuana?",irq,,
209,148_29,P,"I think if the therapy really worked, I would be able to, like, it's just so easy now just to kind of light up. Like, that's an easy fix. And, like, I don't think therapy is going to be that instant. So like it would, it would be tough. I think if I had real confidence that the therapy would work, I could do it. But I mean, it was I have to it would definitely have to work like I just as well as as smoking. ",id,,
210,148_30,T,You would need to see results ?,crq,,
211,148_31,P,"Yeah, yeah, definitely",cd,,
212,148_32,T,would having the job that you're passionate about reduce your anxiety ?,yq,,
213,148_33,P,"After a while, like after I got used to this job, but like just starting the new job would make me kind of anxious. And then like it would be tough not not to smoke or doing that. Like I don't I don't want to get on a drug test anymore because like it's it's being decriminalized being legalized so many places, and there's so much research, saying that it's not that bad. It's kind of like, it's really upsetting that the place that I really want to work sas that policy, I think it's really silly.",op,,
214,148_34,T,you're frustrated. Marijuana is illegal.,crq,,
215,148_35,P,"Yeah, it's Yeah.",cd,,
216,148_36,T,"At the same time, it's the reality you're living in.",gc,,
217,148_37,P,"Right.. Yeah, it's either They will be legalized in like in the state in a couple of years. But until then, like,I mean, I can't wait that long to start start working so",gc,,
218,148_38,T,until then you still need to address this dilemma?,crq,,
219,148_39,P,"Right? Yeah, it's still a problem.",cd,,
220,148_40,T,"So you have choices here, right.  You can continue to use the marijuana and not take the job. ",gc,,
221,148_41,P,Hmm.,gc,,
222,148_42,T,"And that seems like something that has some advantages for you, but some, some disadvantages, right?",crq,,
223,148_43,P,Right,cd,,
224,148_44,T,Because you would really like that job.,gc,,
225,148_45,P,"Yeah. And I would, it's it sounds so pathetic to be like, No, I don't want to take my dream job because I need weed like, sounds really stupid.",gc,,
226,148_46,T,So where do you think you are in terms of making this change? Do you feel motivated to take some steps toward it?,irq,,
227,148_47,P,"I don't like I'm, I'm still kind of on the fence because like if I if I have to give it up for the job, I could do that. But I would definitely need, like some other way to get rid of all this anxiety. Like, whether it's therapy or whether it's like something else I yeah, I would, I would definitely need like a substitute if I got rid of it for good. ",id,,
228,148_48,T,"So you definitely, definitely need it?",crq,,
229,148_49,P,Yeah,cd,,
230,148_50,T,So you can't give up the marijuana unless you have some other available alternative that would help with that anxiety?,yq,,
231,148_51,P,Right.,op,,
232,148_52,T,That's that's key to you to make this change.,gc,,
233,148_53,P,"Yeah. Yeah, definitely. ",gc,,
234,148_54,T,"But at the same time, that would be ideal, because then you could take the job.",gc,,
235,148_55,P,"Right? Yeah. I mean, I mean, if I really thought that I could, like get some kind of treatment that was as good as weed. Yeah, I mean, I could maybe quit, especially the house to get the job, especially.",gc, id,
236,148_56,T,"So with anxiety reduction, your chances of stopping marijuana increase, and then you could take the job that you want",gc,,
237,148_57,P,"Yeah, yeah, I mean, that would be the best the best outcome.",gc,,
238,148_58,T,Is that the outcome you would most want?,yq,,
239,148_59,P,"Yeah, I think so. I think I could give up record, like, doing it with my buddies recreationally. I could, yeah, I'm just going to have a cigarette.",op,,
240,148_60,T,"So here's what I'm thinking. And let me know what you think about this. When you come back next week, right? What if we start looking at this anxiety? When we start, you know, I start treating anxiety. We'll see if we can get it reduced. And kind of work from there. Because maybe when you start to feel if that works, and that anxiety starts to abate, it sounds like it'll just be easier for you to stop the marijuana usage.",gc, id,
241,148_61,P,Yeah. Yeah.,gc,,
242,148_62,T,What kind of timeframe Are you on in terms of taking this job?,irq,,
243,148_63,P,"I mean, the job. It has a high turnover rate, so Like, even if I think I need to apply this week, but if I don't get in more than likely another position like it will open up, like within a month or two.",id,,
244,148_64,T,And when would they drug test you?,irq,,
245,148_65,P,"It would be like, Oh, all right after I apply, so I applied and then did the interview. That's when they will give him the paperwork. And I have to go get drug tested on.",id,,
246,148_66,T,And when did the last time you use Marijuana?,irq,,
247,148_67,P,just a couple days ago.,id,,
248,148_68,T,To see what I'm getting that ?,irq,,
249,148_69,P,"Yeah, yeah, it's uh, yeah. So I like I wouldn't be able to do, I wouldn't be able to make it this application. But I would like to be off it by the next one.",id,,
250,148_70,T,So you're fortunate in the sense that the turnover is high,crq,,
251,148_71,P,right,cd,,
252,148_72,T,Because it gives you an opportunity to apply later on. So do you feel like you can invest in that plan? Let's work on the anxiety. See what happened with the marijuana. See if we can Reduce your usage of it or have you stop that altogether? And then kind of move towards this job?,id, crq,
253,148_73,P,"Yeah, yeah, I could deal with that.",cd,,
254,148_74,T,"Right. So next time you come in, we'll start talking about the anxiety. And let's see what we can do about that. We'll kind of move from there.",gc,,
255,148_75,P,All right. Yeah. Sounds good.,gc,,
256,148_76,T,Sounds good ?,yq,,
257,148_77,P,Yeah,op,,
258,148_78,T,"Thanks, Kylie",gc,,
259,148_79,P,Thank you.,gc,,
260,153_0,T,"Hi Kyle, how have you been ?",gt,,
261,153_1,P,I'm not too good man.,gt,,
262,153_2,T,Not too good?,crq,,
263,153_3,P,"Yeah. So something happened over this past week I was I was driving to my buddy's house and I forgot that my tags for my car is  expired earlier this month. So I got pulled over for that and then I don't know why I did this but the cop asked to search my car and I was like, yeah, that's fine like whatever because he said he had two searches. This is getting towed. And I completely forgot that I had my junk bag in the trunk. So we opened the trunk and he was looking through the bag. So he found me he found everything. I had my weed in there at the bottom the pipe like all my pieces. So I got a, I got in trouble for possession. So I just I just want him to court and the judge offered me this decision. He said that I could either do two weeks of community service like about 80 hours, or I could pay $1,000 fine. And I'm trying to I'm really trying to figure out which one really which one would be better I guess, the both kind of suck but",cd, id,
264,153_4,T,"So you're struggling with the decision between two options you perceived as negative, right. ",crq,,
265,153_5,P,Right.,cd,,
266,153_6,T,Now we've discussed the marijuana usage before was just probably the root of this problem. Right?,crq,,
267,153_7,P,Right.,cd,,
268,153_8,T,But it sounds like you didn't really want to explore change this time.,crq,,
269,153_9,P,"No, I mean, it's it's really not a problem like it's just they don't really want it problem is that I got caught like I'm doing good in school works fine. So obviously like marijuana is other than just going to court It has never been a problem.",cd, id,
270,153_10,T,So let's focus on this decision then.,gc,,
271,153_11,P,Right,gc,,
272,153_12,T,so the decision is between a couple weeks of  community service what kind of community service?,crq,,
273,153_13,P,just picking up crap inside of the road?,cd,,
274,153_14,T,"Or $1,000 fine?",crq,,
275,153_15,P,Yeah.,cd,,
276,153_16,T,And do you have the thousand dollars?,yq,,
277,153_17,P,"I do, but I have I got a vacation coming up and I definitely like I want to I want to keep the money for like a little little vacation we'd like do some, some fun stuff with my buddies. Definitely like I want to keep that money. But I mean, I also like the community service is like also kind of close to the vacation so I might have to like give up part of the vacation or to to do the two weeks so that I think that didn't really help my decision either.",op,,
278,153_18,T,"Do you see any value in either one of these options, which is all become negative?",yq,,
279,153_19,P,"I mean, really, like they both they both have the same negative, I guess like, like if I if I do the community service that I like, you know, I do get to keep the money. But I mean other hand, like if I keep the money, I'm doing community service, like I'm not gonna have all the time to spend the money. So it's now I mean, neither really have a positive and both the negatives are kind of equal to so it's it's kind of tough to choose.",on,,
280,153_20,T,"So let's talk about what's important to try to help you make this decision. Really what you're going to have to determine is, and what I want to explore is the importance of keeping the money. Right, because that's really what this comes down to. ",gc,,
281,153_21,P,Right.,gc,,
282,153_22,T,"You You keep it and you do the service, or you spend it and you don't do the service?",crq,,
283,153_23,P,right,cd,,
284,153_24,T,So you could you could say that it's about the importance of keeping the money rr you could say it's about the importance of avoiding the community service.,crq,,
285,153_25,P,Right.,cd,,
286,153_26,T,"So let's talk a little about that. What How would you say on a scale of one to 10, where 10 is very important. How would you scale keeping the money?",irq,,
287,153_27,P,"I mean, that's obviously pretty high. Like, I guess keeping the money, it'd be like a nine. Because if I, like if I, if I keep the money, obviously, I can, like use it for other other things. I'd say probably nine. ",id,,
288,153_28,T,"So keeping in mind, that's, that's very important to you. ",irq,,
289,153_29,P,Right.,id,,
290,153_30,T,So that scenario would be would lean more toward completing the community service.,irq,,
291,153_31,P,"Right. Yeah, I mean, I guess that's true. Like, I didn't think about it in that way, like if I if I give up the the two weeks of time, like, obviously that would suck, but like I have, I guess I have more of a choice of what to do with money compared to my time. You know, so I guess I could think about it that way maybe",id,,
292,153_32,T,"Well, let's look at the other side too. How important is it for you on a scale of one to 10 to avoid the community service? So we know it's a nine, right to keep the money?",irq,,
293,153_33,P,right.,id,,
294,153_34,T,How to avoid the community service ?,irq,,
295,153_35,P,"Maybe like, I guess maybe about a seven because the like the community service, I mean, it wouldn't be that bad. Obviously, like, it would be a waste of time. We're gonna have to do this crap work for for so long, but I don't know. Like, at least I know if I do the community service and it would be like done after this amount of time. You know, so I can I can always keep that in mind.",id,,
296,153_36,T,"So, as you're talking, it seems like you're leaning toward or maybe you're leaning toward completing the service. Even though you're not happy with either choice, right?",crq,,
297,153_37,P,Right,cd,,
298,153_38,T,That might be the least objectionable.,gc,,
299,153_39,P,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I guess cuz I never like I never thought about scaling it like that way. So yeah, I think so. ",gc,,
300,153_40,T,When do you have to make this decision by ?,irq,,
301,153_41,P,"by the end of the week So today's Tuesday, so I have like a couple of days to think it over.",id,,
302,153_42,T,And you go back before the judge on Friday,gc,,
303,153_43,P,"on Friday, yeah. When I get the decision.",gc,,
304,153_44,T,Once you weigh some of the factors with the way this importance of the money versus doing the community service,gc,,
305,153_45,P,right,gc,,
306,153_46,T,"let's meet again just before maybe on Thursday. Okay, let's meet again Thursday. And just talk about it and take a look at your decision making process and making sure that you've made a decision that you can be most happy with. I know neither option is happy option for you. ",gc,,
307,153_47,P,Right,gc,,
308,153_48,T,They're one that's the least destructive for you the least negative for you,gc,,
309,153_49,P,right,gc,,
310,153_50,T,That's sounds like a plan. ?,crq,,
311,153_51,P,"All right. Yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah, give me some more. ",cd,,
312,153_52,T,"Good, then I'll see there. ",gc,,
313,153_53,P,"Yep, sounds good. ",gc,,
314,153_54,T,Take care.,gc,,
315,154_0,T,Hi Kylie how are you doing today?,gt,,
316,154_1,P,I'm pretty good. How are you Dr. Grande ?,gt,,
317,154_2,T,I'm doing I'm doing well thanks for asking. What's been going on?,gt, irq,
318,154_3,P,"Um, so I've, I've been applying to doctor programs for this upcoming fall. And I'm like, I'm kind of stuck because I got into two of the schools that that I was looking at. I get and like I got into both of them and both of their programs are really good. Both of them have like great research track records and kind of what I want to do. ",id,,
319,154_4,T,Right,gc,,
320,154_5,P,"And yeah, but the problem is is like I don't know how to decide between the two now.",gc,,
321,154_6,T,"Okay, So you, you applied to two places, and you got them both. ",crq,,
322,154_7,P,Hmm,cd,,
323,154_8,T,It sounds like both have programs that are really well suited to what you want to do?,yq,,
324,154_9,P,Right.,op,,
325,154_10,T,And you're having difficulty deciding which one to go with.,irq,,
326,154_11,P,"Yeah. Um, yeah, like I've always I've always had trouble, like, within decisiveness and it's like, when I, when I had two choices of something that's very similar, like I always I always get stuck. And I like, it's very hard for me to actually like make a decision",id,,
327,154_12,T,"Let's are start to the beginning. You definitely want to go on for a PhD. Okay, so we've established that",gc,,
328,154_13,P,right.,gc,,
329,154_14,T,"So it's going to be one of these programs either way. So really, the only question you're really left with is which one? ",crq,,
330,154_15,P,Yeah.,cd,,
331,154_16,T,"So oftentimes, these situations we look at pros and cons, right? Are there any? Well, it sounds like there's a lot of pros to each one. Are there any cons to the one ?",irq,,
332,154_17,P,"I mean, really not, not any that I can think of like, I've tried to, like, I've tried to write them down the piece of paper, do the pros and cons and like the pros look very close. And it's like the same number, but I mean, both programs are good. I have connections with like the some of the teachers and both of them. They're both in the same city. Like they're really close to each other. They're, they're both very similar, but like, for some reason, I just, I don't know, it would be easier if there's like some cons to one of them",id,,
333,154_18,T,It will make the decision easier if you had some negatives that for one of the programs,gc,,
334,154_19,P,right,gc,,
335,154_20,T,"there for the other one. So in a way, you know, I guess this we call quote unquote, good problem",gc,,
336,154_21,P,right,gc,,
337,154_22,T,"It's a problem, but you're choosing between two alternatives that are both really positive for you, but it's there is a choice, right? It's still tough. And you mentioned before that you had some, in your past you're indecisive. ",gc, crq,
338,154_23,P,Yeah.,cd,,
339,154_24,T,"So maybe we can do in this process is help you build decision making skills or contribute to that ability. Because whichever whichever program you get into where you choose, you're gonna have to make decisions later on to ",gc,,
340,154_25,P,right,gc,,
341,154_26,T,"and probably vary, or maybe some of those will be easier, maybe some of those choices won't be as easy. So I think this would be a matter of looking at what's important to you. But you mentioned the research agenda already, or agendas at both universities, that's important, too",gc,,
342,154_27,P,right,gc,,
343,154_28,T,"What are the aspects and maybe not so much thinking about these two universities, but in general, if you had to rank order them, what aspects are really the most important?",irq,,
344,154_29,P,"Um, well, definitely, the research is up there. I definitely want to get that out of out of whichever school I go to. I think something else that's important is for the university to have kind of like maybe a post doctorate plan, whether they have connections with, like businesses where I can get a job like right after graduate or, like if I was going to move into a faculty position, like if they kind of had a pathway that would help set me up for that like that. Those are probably the biggest, like the biggest influencers,",id,,
345,154_30,T,"The research and not a guarantee, necessarily, but some high probability employment?",crq,,
346,154_31,P,right.,cd,,
347,154_32,T,"So really what we could do here, if you want to look at these two universities, even though we don't really have any negatives to look at, we can rank these positives. So it sounds like both have the research that you're looking for that ",gc,,
348,154_33,P,bright,gc,,
349,154_34,T,"they're both there. But if you could rank and maybe you don't have this information right now, but if you could rank them in terms of the next most important aspect, which is really how hard Will you work to find a job? ",irq,,
350,154_35,P,Right,id,,
351,154_36,T,"That's, that's kind of what you're saying. ",gc,,
352,154_37,P,"Okay, right. ",gc,,
353,154_38,T,"I mean, it sounds like what you're saying?",gc,,
354,154_39,P,right,gc,,
355,154_40,T,"So, do you have any information? Or is that something you can find?",irq,,
356,154_41,P,"Um, actually, that's I never thought about like that. Like, I guess I could go online and kind of look at a lot of times universities put up like job acceptance rates like afterwards and they put up percentages, kind of like what what people do afterwards. So maybe if I looked at the websites and kind of found information and see like, how many of them go on to be professors or like work in the industry, maybe maybe I should check that out. That might help me",id,,
357,154_42,T,"that might allow you to have a difference between them because right now, it's like they're just kind of, they're kind of melded together",gc,,
358,154_43,P,right,gc,,
359,154_44,T,"You know, you have you have really no way yet to separate them",gc,,
360,154_45,P,right.,gc,,
361,154_46,T,"So maybe this can build a bit of a discrepancy that the gap between them so you can say, Okay, this one, neither one is bad, right? But this one might be a little better for what I want to do. ",gc,,
362,154_47,P,Okay.,gc,,
363,154_48,T,Does that does that kind of make sense?,yq,,
364,154_49,P,"Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.",op,,
365,154_50,T,"Similarly, as the I think about it, I know whenever I leave speaking with somebody or some situation, that's right, I always think of all the questions I want to ask, right. So when you leave here, you can consider some of the other aspects and like, Think it over like really important to me and try to create that distance between them. So you can look at them as really two separate entities. Another possibility would be to find out this information, maybe talking to representatives from each university. ",gc, id,
366,154_51,P,Okay,gc,,
367,154_52,T,If they may or may not have more information about potential pros and they might even have some cons right now. I'm sure they'll present a plate manner but they can let you know maybe some of the negatives.,gc, id,
368,154_53,P,Okay.,gc,,
369,154_54,T,"Associated With the other university, or maybe some of the positives that aren't quite as positive",gc,,
370,154_55,P,"right, right, ",gc,,
371,154_56,T,"something that they do well with others, other university doesn't do as well. ",gc,,
372,154_57,P,Okay.,gc,,
373,154_58,T,So it sounds like this information gathering would really be your next step.,gc,,
374,154_59,P,Yeah. Yeah. I never actually thought about ranking the the pros and going from there. So I think that's a good idea. Yeah.,gc,,
375,154_60,T,"One of the things that might be helpful to drive is the importance you place on these different aspects, right. So kind of clarify, and we can we meet again, we'll talk about this, but clarify your values and what's important to you. ",gc, id,
376,154_61,P,Okay.,gc,,
377,154_62,T,And then that'll help you to kind of rank some of these attributes.,gc,,
378,154_63,P,"Right. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. ",ack,,
379,154_64,T,"All right. Let's, let's leave it there. And we'll kind of pick up next time with looking at what we talked about. Unless you have any further questions.",gc,,
380,154_65,P,"No, no, I think, yeah, I think I know what I can do afterwards, no we decided.",gc,,
381,154_66,T,So I'll see you in about a week and we'll pick up there,gc, id,
382,154_67,P,Alright sounds good.,gc,,
383,154_68,T,"Thanks, Kyle.",gc,,
384,154_69,P,Hmm,gc,,
385,157_0,T,"Hi, Olive. ",gt,,
386,157_1,P,Hi,gt,,
387,157_2,T,welcome back.,gt,,
388,157_3,P,Thank you.,gt,,
389,157_4,T,How are you?,gt,,
390,157_5,P,feeling pretty intense. Things have kind of gone downhill since I was here last time.,gt, id,
391,157_6,T,Ohh I'm sorry to hear that.,gc,,
392,157_7,P,Yeah.,gc,,
393,157_8,T,"I know last time we talked you  and Kalie had just gotten engaged, and you were rather excited about plans that you had for your life. So So tell me what has happened, what what is what's shifted?",gc, irq,
394,157_9,P,"I think that we've just sort of fallen back. You know, I was really hopeful that and with the proposal also came the promise to, you know, work on the relationship and work on anger and work on, you know, being the couple that we we hope to be, and that it's not happening its not happening. We're right back to where we were. ",id,,
395,157_10,T,"I'm sorry to hear that. I know you were. You were excited. You were feeling hopeful for change. And I don't get that same sense from you right now. In fact, it seems like you're feeling pretty sad and maybe even a little hopeless about that situation. Well, how can I make How can I be helpful and supportive and useful to you right now.",gc, od, gc
396,157_11,P,I just I don't I don't know how to make change. I don't know how to I don't know how to end this. I don't know how to get out. I don't know how to. I just I can't do it anymore.,id,,
397,157_12,T,"So you've decided to make a change. And in fact, it sounds like you've decided to leave the relationship. ",gc,,
398,157_13,P,"I don't know. I mean, I want to I don't want to be in it. But I don't, I don't know how to get to not being in it.",id,,
399,157_14,T,"So you're thinking about it. It's not that you've committed or decided that you absolutely want to leave the relationship. But correct me if I'm wrong. What you're saying is, you want to make a change, and you don't want this relationship as it is. ",gc, crq,
400,157_15,P,Yeah.,cd,,
401,157_16,T,"Now, what what are you when you think about changing? What what ideas? I mean, I guess you mentioned leaving, what other possibilities or thoughts have you had about change and what that might look like?",irq,,
402,157_17,P,"I don't know. It just feels so overwhelming when I think about it. I just I can't seem to find a way out of it. and that feels feels ethical. It feels like it can No, I don't want to hurt her. I just don't want to be in this relationship anymore.",id,,
403,157_18,T,Why don't you want to be in this relationship anymore?,irq,,
404,157_19,P,"It's not healthy. It's I'm not happy. I can't imagine that she's happy even though she says she is. It's, you know, we're fighting constantly. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with her. She's overprotective. She just it doesn't feel right. just doesn't feel right.",id,,
405,157_20,T,"It doesn't feel right. So, what would feel right?",irq,,
406,157_21,P,"Ah, that's a huge question. I just don't I'm not sure just this isn't right.",id,,
407,157_22,T,"So the way things are is not right. It's not working, you don't feel supported. This isn't the kind of relationship that that you want or that you had hoped that it would be. ",crq,,
408,157_23,P,"Yeah. I mean, when we started it was it was lovely. She was amazing. She was this super caring and thoughtful woman and you know, we are lots of same interests, you know, same friends it's, you know, she was just fantastic. And I don't know, I don't know where that changed. And I feel like we did this on again off again stuff and it's just, it just seems like, just not right. And I know, I know, I don't deserve to be treated this way. And I know that I'm, I'm better than that.",cd, id,
409,157_24,T,"You really value your self and your well being and in your spirit. And it sounds like you don't feel like you're taking good care of yourself by staying in this relationship and Even though things started out well, they haven't turned out to be the kind of relationship that you want for yourself",gc, crq,
410,157_25,P,"No, but you know, but she's lovely and I love her and I can't imagine. I can't imagine my life without her in it.",cd,,
411,157_26,T,So you feeling torned?,yq,,
412,157_27,P,Yeah,op,,
413,157_28,T,"you're you're torned between your love and affection for her and your sense of honoring yourself, and you've got a lot of mixed feelings. And you are saying that you need something to change that sounds like you're able to kind of hold that complexity, if you will, that you've got these strong feelings for this person and you don't feel like this is the good relationship for you. ",gc, crq,
414,157_29,P,No. I think it's  not good for either one of us.,cd,,
415,157_30,T,"For both of you. Yeah. So so then you've talked a little bit about leaving. I mean, tell me more about what you thought about. And when you think about making a change in terms of leaving, what, what might that look like for you?",gc, irq,
416,157_31,P,"I don't know. I mean, it feels. I just can't imagine my life without her in it. So the idea of not having her there feels really scary. And the idea of staying the way it is, and things not changing, feels even scarier. So I don't I don't know how to and I don't even know how I would do that. Our lives are so intertwined. I mean, my business, our friends, the queer community is so small, you know, that's my family as much as my friends and my family as well. And so just, you know, how do you how do you extract yourself from that in a way For me, like, in a way that I feel, I'm doing that with grace and respect for her and respect for myself.",id,,
417,157_32,T,"What What thoughts do you have about how you do that? How do you extract yourself? How might you extract yourself in a way that has some integrity and grace as you said,",irq,,
418,157_33,P,"I don't I don't even know. I mean, talk to my friend Jay about it and I don't know he suggested like a break, but I don't I don't know. I just don't want to get caught in that on again off again before like, you know, like we've done before and, but the idea of a break. feels a little less. I don't know, maybe more gentle. I don't know,",id,,
419,157_34,T,say more a little more gentle.,crq,,
420,157_35,P,"I don't know how to give us both time to really think about it and and I don't know, maybe maybe she'll change maybe maybe if I'm you know, if this is it, if this is it, like if this break is it, maybe Maybe she'll be able to change.",cd, id,
421,157_36,T,"I heard you say that. Live it, you know, moving on and having a life without Kelly is really scary. In fact, it's almost impossible for you to imagine what that would look like, especially with the way that your lives are so intertwined. I also heard you say that the thought of not making a change is scarier. And I was wondering if you could say a little bit more about what you mean by that.",irq,,
422,157_37,P,"It's just I feel exhausted. I feel like I'm not. I'm not who I was. When I came into this relationship. I feel like I'm constantly struggling to make her happy, and that just doesn't work. There's nothing I can do. And I feel like I've lost my joy. And I don't know. I'm just afraid of what will happen if I just keep staying in a place where I feel like I'm falling apart. Hmm, my piece. ",id,,
423,157_38,T,"Yeah. So you're concerned about your own well being and your own joy and your, your spirit if you you stay and don't make this change, and that's the part that's really scary for you. ",crq,,
424,157_39,P,Yeah.,cd,,
425,157_40,T,You mentioned that your friend suggested possibly taking a little break. And you said that that was a scary thought for you. And I guess I'd like to hear more additional thoughts you might have about that as a as an option for you.,gc,,
426,157_41,P,"Well, it seems like I mean, if it could happen if we could find a way to make it happen that it would be it would just give me some time to think about, like, what I want and what I need and, and, you know, I feel like I can't sort out what's me in this anymore. And, and so like if I have that space, just to sort of breathe and not have to worry about her feelings and Taking care of her and just being able to focus on myself for a little while. I don't know, it seems like that would be helpful.",gc, id,
427,157_42,T,"It sounds like you're feeling like you're so in, in it just so in the the mixed emotions and the sense of hopelessness and sadness and disappointment that it's really hard for you to see out of it. And an advantage reason to take a break would be just to give you a moment to breathe and look around and collect yourself and not be so stuck in that ambivalence, if you will, that sense of not knowing. ",crq,,
428,157_43,P,Yeah.,cd,,
429,157_44,T,"well, if you don't mind, I'd love to ask you to take a look at this ruler here. I just kind of wrote this down really quickly, but on a scale of zero to 10 zero being not motivated at all and 10 being extremely motivated. how motivated would you say you are to take a break in your relationship right now?",irq,,
430,157_45,P,oh six So somewhat motivated.,id,,
431,157_46,T,Why a six and not a one?,irq,,
432,157_47,P,Because I need I need it. I feel like I'm losing myself. So I feel like,id,,
433,157_48,T,it's important?,crq,,
434,157_49,P,Yeah.,cd,,
435,157_50,T,"Well, so so why a six and not a nine? Or 10? ",irq,,
436,157_51,P,"Cuz I'm not sure how to make it happen. Yeah, I don't I don't know.",id,,
437,157_52,T,"So it's important to you, and you're not maybe fully confident or sure about the how part.",crq,,
438,157_53,P,Yeah,cd,,
439,157_54,T,how to make it happen?,crq,,
440,157_55,P,Exactly.,cd,,
441,157_56,T,"Well, kind of following up on that on a scale of zero to 10 zero being not confident at all. 10 being extremely confident. How confident are you that if you decided to take a break from your relationship with Kelly, you would be successful at making that happen?",irq,,
442,157_57,P,I don't know maybe like a three or four.,id,,
443,157_58,T,"So, so less confident or less confident than you are motivated. Why a three Not a zero.",irq,,
444,157_59,P,"Because I, I'm on it. I mean, I do something I want.",id,,
445,157_60,T,Mm hmm. And so wanting it makes you feel confident that you confident to some extent that you could actually make it happen.,gc,,
446,157_61,P,"Yeah, yeah. ",gc,,
447,157_62,T,Why three and not an eight or nine?,irq,,
448,157_63,P,"I can't control her. I don't know how she would react and I just don't want any more arguments and anger. And yeah, I don't want to hurt her. So.",id,,
449,157_64,T,"So when you think about taking this break, you're also thinking about how she might respond and what she might do and that creates this whole other kind of set of worries. It, it undermines your sense of confidence onon some level.",gc, irq,
450,157_65,P,it creates a lot of anxiety for me.,id,,
451,157_66,T,Yeah. What do you think needs to be different in order for you to feel more confident about successfully being able to take a brief break.,orq,,
452,157_67,P,"I think I like maybe a plan, like just knowing, knowing what the rules are sort of like where, where I want to go with it. And when I'm home, I don't know what I want to accomplish.",od,,
453,157_68,T,"So thinking through an actual plan, like what you would say how long what the boundaries are, might might help you. ",crq,,
454,157_69,P,"Yeah, regard. ",cd,,
455,157_70,T,"Okay. And then one final question on a scale of zero to 10. Zero being not ready at all. And 10 being extremely ready. How ready would you say you are to commit to taking some kind of brief break in the, let's say, the next couple of weeks.",irq,,
456,157_71,P,I think an eight,id,,
457,157_72,T,so pretty ready?,crq,,
458,157_73,P,Yeah.,cd,,
459,157_74,T,"And, and you've spoken to this already a little bit, I believe, but I'll ask you again, why an eight and not a one or two ?",irq,,
460,157_75,P,because I know if I just let it drag out that I'm going to be miserable.,id,,
461,157_76,T,"So your sense of readiness is actually really connected to your motivation that is that this is something you know, that you need to do for yourself. And if you don't, things are not going to get any better. And that that makes you both motivated and even more ready. Well, why why an eight and not a ten?",gc, irq,
462,157_77,P,"That's, you know, scary. Change is hard and thinking about not being the woman I thought I was gonna marry that makes me sad.",id,,
463,157_78,T,"So your emotions, your sense of maybe sadness and in grief and disappointment around this detract from your sense of readiness and in some way",crq,,
464,157_79,P,sort of giving up on a dream.,cd,,
465,157_80,T,"Yeah, and so, another aspect to that to your whole experience says that you're you're grieving. The relationship isn't even over yet, but you're grieving the dream and the hopes that you had. And that's a that's a heaviness and certainly a factor and in what you do next?",gc, irq,
466,157_81,P,"yeah, ",cd,,
467,157_82,T,"well, if I could take just a moment and make sure I've captured and understood everything you've shared with me and I, I know this is really difficult to talk about. So I really appreciate you spending the time to share with me with with this has been like for you. You've been feeling stuck. And things were great for a while you had some hope that things were going to change and now you are realizing that Kelly's not going to change and that you are suffering in the process that you are really being kept from your aspirations and your dreams, in a lot of different regards. You know, that you need to make a change, you want to make a change, and you have a lot of mixed feelings about this change. You know, it's what you want to do, it's the right thing for you. And you still really care and love, Kelly. And you're also concerned, kind of on an outer level, about your business, about your community, about your family and your friends and how they may be affected by a breakup. In order to make this more manageable, you're thinking maybe in terms of smaller change, like taking a small break, as opposed to breaking off the relationship and you feel like you're pretty ready. You're somewhat You know, you're motivated. And then maybe a little less confident. But you also said that if you were able to maybe think through a concrete plan, that that might help you feel more confident. ",gc, id,
468,157_83,P,Yeah.,gc,,
469,157_84,T,"And that's certainly something that we could do together next time we meet if that's alright with you. I'd be happy to hear your ideas, maybe even share some suggestions with you about a possible plan.",gc,,
470,157_85,P,That'd be great.,gc,,
471,157_86,T,Is that alright?,crq,,
472,157_87,P,Yeah. Thank you.,cd,,
473,157_88,T,Thank you very much for your time. I really appreciate it.,cd,,
474,16_0,T,"Nicole, how are doing today?",gt,,
475,16_1,P,I'm doing well Maria.,gt,,
476,16_2,T,Doing well. Thanks for asking. What brings you into our agency today?,gt,irq,
477,16_3,P,"Well, I've really just been feeling kind of anxious every time I go to work.",id,,
478,16_4,T,"feeling anxious every time you go to work, what type of place to work.",crq,,
479,16_5,P,"I work just an insurance company, sort of an admin assistant.",cd,,
480,16_6,T,Work for insurance company and how long have you been feeling anxious? there?,irq,,
481,16_7,P,"Well, I've started a little over a year ago.",id,,
482,16_8,T,Have you ever had anxiety like that? A previous employer or any other place?,crq,,
483,16_9,P,"Yeah, I would say when I've started new jobs or even in new academic environments, I would feel somewhat anxious. So",cd,,
484,16_10,T,"this is somewhat familiar, exciting. Mm hmm. Tell me about things I,",gc,,
485,16_11,P,"um, well, it starts you know, when I wake up in the morning and get ready to go to work, even when I'm driving in, I just start to get anxious. And then once I'm there, I really just, you know, I go to work and I do what I'm supposed to do, but I try to keep to myself. You know, I don't really enjoy interacting with some of my co workers and",gc,,
486,16_12,T,what is it that happens when you try to interact with,irq,,
487,16_13,P,"um, I guess I just, I haven't really connected with any of them and I, I tend to worry about whether I'm doing my job right or if they like me, things like that. So it's just easier to stick to my my own office.",id,,
488,16_14,T,"Okay, so you have an office have separate offices. And you find yourself maybe isolating a little bit. Yeah,",crq,,
489,16_15,P,I guess you could say that.,cd,,
490,16_16,T,"So what is the what is your experience of anxiety when you're kind of? I'm sure there are situations and diaries, more or less have to interact with other people to limit your experience of anxiety.",irq,,
491,16_17,P,You mean how I'm feeling or what type of situations that happens in?,crq,,
492,16_18,T,"Well, let's cover both. Let's start with what type of situations triggers it",cd,,
493,16_19,P,"Okay, um, I guess whenever I'm in a big crowd, purchase with a bunch of coworkers. If we have meetings or they ask for my input on input on something, I tend to get nervous and I just wonder, you know, if I'm saying the right thing, and then that sort of makes me get nervous around them. And then when I start to feel nervous, I get some stomach pains. I really would prefer just to stop talking, stop the meeting. And then I get, you know, a little red and blush, as well, whenever we have meetings.",id,,
494,16_20,T,Do you ever have a desire to leave? Like if you're in a group just to kind of exterior?,irq,,
495,16_21,P,"Oh, yeah, all the time. Um, I try not to because I don't want to do a bad job and I don't, you know, I don't want to perform poorly. But sometimes the anxiety just takes over a little bit, and I just would prefer to go back to my office and be by myself.",id,,
496,16_22,T,"And how distressing is this for you? I mean, obviously, you're here. So it must be some level of distress but how disruptive is it to your functioning?",irq,,
497,16_23,P,"Why would say I'm, you know, when I drive into work, you know, like it's I feel anxious every day and I've really just been thinking about leaving my job and finding something else where I can potentially even be more secluded and not have to go to meetings frequently or make presentations or anything like that.",id,,
498,16_24,T,So meetings and presentations in particular trigger.,crq,,
499,16_25,P,"I was saying, Yeah, I would say so. Anything where a lot of people are looking at me more than a few, I guess you could say.",cd,,
500,16_26,T,"Can you tell me a little bit more about the physical symptoms? You mentioned your stomach hurt, when you feel anxious? Is there any other any other symptoms going on? You could feel physically,",irq,,
501,16_27,P,"um, well, sometimes my palms will get sweaty, my face will get red or I'll get overheated. But mostly it's just some stomach pains leading up to you know, throughout the day, like if I'm thinking about what I have to do, that makes me anxious I'll start to get some stomach pains.",id,,
502,16_28,T,"So when these anxiety episodes are more intense, like when you when your stomach hurts, and you have other symptoms, Are you worried about it happening again? Like, are you worried that those symptoms are gonna occur again, that makes you have more symptoms?",crq,,
503,16_29,P,"I'm not always worried about it happening again. I mean, sometimes I can anticipate it happening. And I would like to avoid it. But I would say here and there, I would worry about getting the stomach pains or blushing in front of people, things like that, but it's not every time.",cd,,
504,16_30,T,Tell me about the meetings that you have. You mentioned that you have meetings you have to go to expected. How many people be in a typical meeting?,irq,,
505,16_31,P,"Well, it's a pretty small company, but I would say probably anywhere between five and 10. Most of them are above me though. their positions are above me So,",id,,
506,16_32,T,so five to 10 how often these meetings scheduled,irq,,
507,16_33,P,"About once or twice a week regularly, and then sometimes we might meet more than that if something needs to be addressed.",id,,
508,16_34,T,"Right, so somewhat unplanned.",crq,,
509,16_35,P,Mm hmm. And then some happen weekly. Okay.,cd,,
510,16_36,T,"So for the ones that are planned, you get anxious in advanced welcome.",crq,,
511,16_37,P,"Oh, yeah, definitely. I mean, I think about it, as soon as I know, I always know it's coming. So I'm always thinking about, you know, the next meeting that I'll have to present at or how I'll have to contribute. And then I just sort of I think about it until it happens, and then it's a cycle.",cd,,
512,16_38,T,"All right. So the meetings triggered, generally not being isolated in the office kind of triggers this anxiety. Right. But there's other times it sounds like we're not anxious when you're isolating the office. How would have hungry anxious now? ",irq,,
513,16_39,P,I'm not really when I'm by myself. I don't really feel anxious.,id,,
514,16_40,T,"So really, it's when you get up for work and start thinking about the work day, especially if they're meetings, right? That sort of starts to,",orq,,
515,16_41,P,"yeah, like if I have off work for a couple of days, I don't feel anxious at all. It's really just when I'm going to work when I know that I'm going to have to be talking to a lot of people or making presentations, things like that.",od,,
516,16_42,T,So you suffer the anxiety advance of these plan meetings? How about the unplanned meetings? What's your experience of those?,irq,,
517,16_43,P,"Well, I mean, unplanned meetings, I, I don't really have a lot of time to think about them happening. But I would say even when I'm put on the spot and have to present anything or just even having a long discussion where a lot of people are looking at me or you know, listening to me for a long period of time, I would still say I get pretty anxious about that as well.",id,,
518,16_44,T,So both really causing say that's really troubling if you're suffering,yq,,

617,198_12,T,"Okay, well, I'm glad you've come to counseling, because it's good for us to get an outsider's opinion when we've got so much on our plate, and we confused as to what to do and our emotions can get in the way. And you just said earlier that a whole lot of stuffs on your plate at the moment. Okay. So I'm glad you've come here. Here with the clinic We use the ABC model, which is a cognitive behavioral therapy model. So Marsha, some counselors have put together a list of beliefs that we often use. And we don't realize that we're using those beliefs and they tend to be faulty ones. Here's the least here. Have a look through that to see if there are any beliefs that you might be operating on at the moment.",gc,irq,
618,198_13,P,"I think number two,",id,,
619,198_14,T,okay. Read that one out for me,crq,,
620,198_15,P,that it's necessary to have a high degree of uncertainty in order to be happy and perform well.,cd,,
621,198_16,T,Yeah. You mentioned that,ack,,
622,198_17,P,Number 4 that it's necessary to be competent and successful in all those things which are attempted.,id,,
623,198_18,T,"Hmm yeah, that's an expectation from your family. ",ack,,
624,198_19,P,Yeah. Possibly number eight. That loss should be entirely pleasant ending And enjoyable that any frustration discomfortable pain would be unbearable.,id,,
625,198_20,T,Hmm. Yeah. Which one of those stands out the most for you at the moment?,irq,,
626,198_21,P,Umm probabily number 4. Yeah.,id,,
627,198_22,T,"How would you put that, in your own words?",irq,,
628,198_23,P,That I need to be successful all the time andeverything that I do.,id,,
629,198_24,T,Hmm.,ack,,
630,198_25,P,Yeah.,ack,,
631,198_26,T,And is that different from what's happening in your life at the moment?,irq,,
632,198_27,P,"Well, failing that exam I mean, I wasn't successful with that. So yeah, it just throws out I guess even number two, because throw that all the order in my life. I'd need to have everything. I need to know what I'm doing where I'm going. Yes.",id,,
633,198_28,T,"Okay, so if number four is an expectation that your family has given that you have of yourself How do you measure up next to number four?",irq,,
634,198_29,P,I don't feel like I'm good enough.,id,,
635,198_30,T,"Okay. All right. Well, what I'd like to do is, is put some of those ideas on the board under the ABC. And I'll explain as we go along. ",gc,,
636,198_31,P,Okay.,ack,,
637,198_32,T,Okay. So what do you think the trigger point might be or the activating event for you at the moment?,irq,,
638,198_33,P,"I mean, there are a lot of things, but I think, obviously filing the exam was the main one.",id,,
639,198_34,T,"All right. And, and the consequences, you thinking of leaving uni. And, and that statement you made earlier about? Yeah, that's, that's the one. That's the crucial one, and I'll explain it shortly when I get up to the board. ",gc,,
640,198_35,P,Okay.,ack,,
641,198_36,T,"Okay, I think I'll put it up there now for you so we can work through that. So Marsha, the activating event, which is what you stated earlier And the kind of decision that you're thinking about is ",gc,,
642,198_37,P,leaving Uni?,crq,,
643,198_38,T,That's right okay. So it's important that we consider the jump from here over to here. And the kind of thinking that you've been swirling around in your head affects the consequence. And you've mentioned earlier that number four seems to fit. And you put that in your own words. What are your words before?,cd,irq,
644,198_39,P,That I'm not good enough.,id,,
645,198_40,T,"It's really important for us to consider that kind of thinking, hmm. Okay, Marsha, it's good that we've got those things on the board. And what I'd like to do now is focus, stepping out a bit from your situation and looking, looking at it from another point of view. To me, it sounds like you've, you're doing a whole lot of things really well. Can you list all of the things that you're doing really well?",id,irq,
646,198_41,P,"I'm working, It's a really demanding job, You know, keeping up with it. I guess. Things that my fiance I mean, we're engaged. So planning the wedding That's going really well. It's stressful, but it's going well.",id,,

651,198_46,T,You're juggling it. And it's a lot on your plate at the moment. But it sounds like you've been able to cope up until this point of the one exam.,crq,,
652,198_47,P,Yeah. This one just threw me off balance. just failing.,cd,,
653,198_48,T,"So, would you describe yourself as successful most of the time?",irq,,
654,198_49,P,"Yeah, Most of the time",id,,
655,198_50,T,Yeah. And what's the evidence for that?,irq,,
656,198_51,P,passing all my fans all the time. I'm just passing my subjects not getting that full time job. It's a great job that I'm doing. I'm getting married.,id,,
657,198_52,T,"Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So how do all of those successes compared to that belief that you've written that I've written on the board for you?",irq,,
658,198_53,P,"I guess in comparison, I am good enough.",id,,
659,198_54,T,"Yeah, that's right. Yeah. And all the evidence is there. All of the subjects that you've passed in first year, and now second year. year round, full time job. That's a success. Yeah, it's great. Yeah. Good. Okay. Well, what I'd like to do is get you to write that on the board to dispute that belief. Okay. Yeah. Would you do that?",ack,irq,
660,198_55,P,Alright,gc,,
661,198_56,T,Well done last That's a powerful statement. What kind of decision goes along with that?,irq,,

664,198_59,P,Okay,ack,,

675,198_70,T,"Okay, good. Okay. What I'd like you to do is to keep saying that statement. I am good enough to say it in front of the mirror two or three times a day, so that you build up your confidence, because it's going to take some time to reprogram you confuse it or up here with that kind of positive belief of about yourself, rather than carrying around that other belief. And we tend to carry those other beliefs for years and years and years. And so it's going to take a bit of work on your part to deliberately change your thinking and change your belief system. But you've made a great start here today. So congratulations.",id,gt,
676,198_71,P,Thank you,gt,,
677,201_0,T,So today's the day,id,,

You know, I, I, I know that I said I would do this, but I really haven't been able to stop thinking about it the whole week, and I am sure you know, my chest is tight. I almost didn't come I almost called and canceled. I just I don't really think that I can I can do this. I can't, I can't get in the car and drive over to that mall. If I walk inside, I know I am going to lose it. I imagine these I imagine these crowds of people, you know, going up and down and like, I almost feel like the walls are coming in on me when I start thinking about that.

Could we take Can I just do something I want to I want to do something. In terms of creating a history. I want to create a history right here, instead of cap something like what this would. What does how the mind works? Hmm, could we do something kind of odd? You're gonna play so let me do something.",yq,,

708,201_31,P,"Yeah, probably still I'd probably still say whoo.",id,,
709,201_32,T,"But as long as you've struggled with this with the way the mind works, what do you think is going to happen as we come to this day?",irq,,
710,201_33,P,"Oh, I see. So I've, I've been thinking for years that that I'll lose it if I get, get into a crowd and hear what's happening again, and I'm thinking about, you know,",id,,
711,201_34,T,"exactly, if that's if that's the determine, determine if that's what we're going to turn it over tomean, we're, we're never like inside Letting that run your life is what brought you in here. Think of all the cost that it's produced. So let's see if we can do something different. I got a ticket ticket a moment to sort of get in touch with how old this is.

720,201_43,P,if I can learn that a pen goes whoo in two seconds.,cd,,
721,201_44,T,"Okay. So here's what I'd like to ask. We're about to get up and go do this thing. We agree. And it sounds like your mind is engaged. We did it to find Mr. anxiety, right? So it's like we're here And we're right on this pivot point where we're going to do something different. And here's the thing I'd like to ask you. It's different, but With regard to that, would you be willing to do this and as you go, you can tell me what's coming coming up. I want you to actually watch your mind go as it constructs those scary futures and just notice it. Like, sort of like the way you carry something that's fragile. wants you to just to set a notice. Like it's not your enemy, and it's not your boss. It's your mind doing its thing. Would you be willing to sort of do it that spirit? Let's see what's there. This is kind of watch it go. ",gc, yq,
722,201_45,P,"Yeah, I can try. Yeah. But I can feel. Yeah, I think it's my mind kicking in telling me that I'm going to fall apart.",op,,
723,201_46,T,"Yeah, good catch. So even that, even that thought that came up, as I said that, let's do this. Okay,",gc,,
724,201_47,P,"Yeah, I guess it is ",ack,,
725,201_48,T,How is anxiety.,irq,,
726,201_49,P,"Yeah, but I'm not sure that I can I can do it. I've been just beside myself ever since last week, thinking that I was gonna have to go through this and I'm not sure I can I mean chest is tight like no sweat running down my back. I'm petrified, you know i suit you're afraid of like what kind of no I actually ",id,,
727,201_50,T,You go there thinking what's gonna happen?,irq,,
728,201_51,P,"Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna lose it I'm gonna lose it before I get inside the front door lose it anyway, I couldn't predict ",id,,
729,201_52,T,what's going to happen ?,irq,,
730,201_53,P,"but I don't know. pass out I go crazy. It's a I hate crowds and I hate being around those people and and, you know, I know I said I would I know that. We plan that we go over there, but it's just too much I just can't do it. ",id,,
731,201_54,T,"Okay. That's surprising. You'd be thinking this. This is an old thought. It's, it's where you started. I mean, it's how you've been thinking.",gc,,
732,201_55,P,"Yeah, that's true. But that doesn't mean it's not true. ",gc,,
733,201_56,T,"But well, let me just that ask you this terms of the truth and that truth means different things. But in all these years, you've been thinking things like that. Have you actually lost it?",gc, yq,
734,201_57,P,"No, no, but I haven't. I haven't really done it much cheaper.",on,,
735,201_58,T,And then once I've been able to test it to see if it's really true,gc,,
736,201_59,P,"yeah, I mean, you know, once or twice maybe I've managed to spend a little time in crowd ",gc,,
737,201_60,T,"so far is appeared as as far as you know, this is just a thought.",gc,,
738,201_61,P,Yeah. I guess that's true. I don't have any any evidence that it would absolutely happen alone. sure as hell feels like it's gonna happen.,gc,,
739,201_62,T,"So well, you know, be one thing. It's worth noticing that and something that for us to kind of hang on to when we go there that when your mind gets on you there that you remember, this is just a thought it's not true as far as you know, from as far as we know, correctly.",gc,,
740,201_63,P,"Yeah, I mean, I guess. ",gc,,
741,201_64,T,"Okay. No, not true. Can I do something that's a little odd, just a little silly to kind of look at this in a different way. ",gc, yq,
742,201_65,P,Okay,op,,
743,201_66,T,we're gonna have to do something different. We're not going to get anything different.,gc,,
744,201_67,P,That makes sense.,gc,,
745,201_68,T,"So give me a cartoon character that to like,",crq,,
746,201_69,P,Donald Duck.,cd,,
747,201_70,T,"Okay, Donald Duck. So suppose these thoughts were actually something that was like what kind of thoughts would come up if you go to the mall? It's what's gonna happen",irq,,
748,201_71,P,it's gonna be go to the car and sir walking towards the the entrance and it's just gonna be bad. It's gonna be terrible.,id,,
749,201_72,T,"Okay, so your Donald Duck says bad ",crq,,
750,201_73,P,that's ridiculous.,cd,,
751,201_74,T,"Well, first, you know, the thoughts are similarly ridiculous. I mean here you sort of turning your life over to things that you don't know are true. And that could just be silly thought about what kind of thoughts would come up there could  we actually go there and in mentally, I could Do you sort of have your thoughts being a Donald Duck horse just so that you can see them as something that's silly which may be able to give you a little bit of freedom from them because you know what happens if you just turn you know, turn your life over huh? ",gc, irq,
752,201_75,P,"Yeah, I mean I guess they are pretty silly thoughts and I'm not sure that I can do that voice quite so well ",id,,
753,201_76,T,"versus the result of a misspent youth. What other kind of thoughts Yeah, like if you go",gc,,
754,201_77,P,"Yeah, you know, if I if I go Am I gonna lose, I'm gonna hyperventilate. Yeah, I see we come from Yeah, that's Well,",gc,,
755,201_78,T,"I just want you to sort of hang on to that a little bit when it really gets up on you so that you can remember, these things are not true as far as you know. And there's, it is kind of a silly thing to allow them to do what they've done. And so we'll just you tell me what they are. If you can'tdo it mentally in your head, I'll say it out loud. I can probably say most of these thoughts. Donald back wise, would you be willing to do it that way?",gc, yq,
756,201_79,P,"Yeah, well, I have to say I think make it a lot easier. Just distract but ",op,,
757,201_80,T,never mind.What would you say,irq,,
758,201_81,P,Okay.,id,,
759,201_82,T,"So, what's inside this decision?",irq,,
760,201_83,P,"Well, I just get really nervous because I'm supposed to choose I have one more semester left and I get worried because I'm not sure if I'm on the right paths, and I don't want to make the wrong decisions. And then my parents are telling me you know, my dad wants me to do one thing and, and I feel like I just get it thrown in lots of different directions. And, and then my teachers tell me one thing, and I just feel like there's six of me trying to do different things. ",id,,
761,201_84,T,"If you could settle them down just to to the two major ones, what would be the two major alternatives that you have here? ",irq,,
762,201_85,P,"Well, I mean, ultimately, my family and I still want to have friends and I'm really young still and I get and then the career choices and wanting to be successful.",id,,
763,201_86,T,Okay. Which of those is more important you think?,orq,,
764,201_87,P,"Well, I mean, I definitely feel a lot better when I'm around people that I love and stuff, but then also, I've always been told careers The most important thing and making money and and all that but I just, I just keep feeling like I'm failing. ",od,,
765,201_88,T,"Okay, so it seems like if you do one, you don't get the other and if that's really true, are there things in there where you could do both",gc,,
766,201_89,P,"Well, I mean, I feel like if I'm committed to school then I'm committed to school. And I just don't have the time.",gc,,
767,201_90,T,Yet it does does take time but not forever.,gc,,
768,201_91,P,"Or no, but for now",gc,,
769,201_92,T,seems like you're kind of almost anxious when you talk about it here.,crq,,
770,201_93,P,"Yeah, it's it makes me I just can't really, because I don't know. I just don't know what the right direction to go in.",cd,,
771,201_94,T,I don't know. Maybe you just need to follow your heart here is make a choice. But how long have you been sitting on this fence? It's obviously it seems like you're sitting on a fence.,gc,,
772,201_95,P,"Well, I mean, I guess since I had to choose which college to go to in high school.",gc,,
773,201_96,T,Is there any other way to do it other than just the Nike solution? Just do it?,crq,,
774,201_97,P,"I don't, I don't see it. I mean, I feel like I am just doing it. I'm just not going anywhere with it. Okay?",cd,,
775,201_98,T,Maybe we're just not thinking about it broadly enough in an open enough way.,od,,
776,201_99,P,I feel like I'm covering all the bases.,gc,,
777,201_100,T,"Oh, what's inside this choice, I guess?",irq,,
778,201_101,P,"Well, I just feel like I get torn into different pieces trying to please my family and my friends, but then also trying to be motivated to choose a career which I still don't know what I want to do.",id,,
779,201_102,T,Even as you say that there's a sort of sense that we're entering into a kind of chattery world do you feel as though you're kind of getting into space?,gc, yq,
780,201_103,P,Yeah,op,,
781,201_104,T,"like if we were to just do it metaphorically Like, how close are your thoughts about Am I doing the right thing if we use distance as a metaphor for how close to Have a sense that",gc,,
782,201_105,P,"Yeah, yeah. blinding.",ack,,
783,201_106,T,"Yeah, yeah, exactly. And that, is that a pretty familiar place to be?",gc, yq,
784,201_107,P,Yeah.,op,,
785,201_108,T,Right.,ack,,
786,201_109,P,Yeah.,ack,,
787,201_110,T,"So and not just in this area, right?",crq,,
788,201_111,P,No,cd,,
789,201_112,T,"without without any other decisions and choices. So it's just worth noticing that, you know, that's kind of how your mind works. Probably trying to help you out here, but it's doing something that's probably pretty familiar. But what would happen if we kind of just sort of noticed more openly, what your minds doing and also just what's showing up for you and in your body and your emotions? We look at the sec Nice. Notice the kind of almost holding ",gc,,
790,201_113,P,Yeah,ack,,
791,201_114,T,like this decision has been made now.,gc,,
792,201_115,P,Yeah.,ack,,
793,201_116,T,"So come back to it now and just sort of watch your mind kind of come up like this and see if we can just kind of watch it. There. Okay, so you do have a choice to make. There's only one. I mean, life is finite, don't get to do everything. Right, right. Yeah. And that's a little scary. Yeah. And so what does your mind start saying to you?",gc, irq,
794,201_117,P,"Well, I feel like every time I make a positive decision to go one way, it's leaving another thing behind, and then I hold on to the thing that I'm going to be missing out on.",id,,
795,201_118,T,"Yeah, exactly. So just before don't grab that. So provide them close. Just didn't notice that. Okay. And would that be okay, to have that sort of sense? I don't know if I made the right decision. Like, what's inside that? Would it be okay to have that thought?",gc, irq,
796,201_119,P,It's scary to not know,id,,
797,201_120,T,Yeah it is.,ack,,
798,201_121,P,"But I mean, I guess I don't really have control over that. Okay.",gc,,
799,201_122,T,"And could we sort of open up it is a little scary. We make choices you do open doors, and you close others. ",gc,,
800,201_123,P,Yeah.,ack,,
801,201_124,T,"And even that sounds a bit scary. Is that Okay. There's something supposed to happen here when you make career choices, is it not supposed to have any scariness to it?",gc, yq,
802,201_125,P,"Well, it is scary. So, yeah.",op,,
803,201_126,T,So let's see if we can just kind of open up to that. But that's okay too. You're not doing anything wrong here. It's not an indication something bad is happening here.,gc,,
804,201_127,P,Right.,ack,,
805,214_0,T,"Okay, so I wrote a prescription for an answer. biotic four, eight, and that should help with the ear infection. But in looking through the chart, I mean, it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so. That's really a big problem.",gc,,

813,214_8,T,"Well, now's the time to quit. It's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking, not only for him, like I said, but also for you. You're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for emphysema for oral cancers for heart disease for all kinds. ",id,,
814,214_9,P,I know I know. I've heard people have told me before I've heard all that. I just don't know how to do it. How am I supposed to quit? It's So hard.,orq,ack,
815,214_10,T,"Well, there's all kinds of things you can use. Now, it's not as hard as it used to be. You can use nicotine replacement. There's patches, there's lozenges, there's gum, there's the inhaler, there's nasal spray, we can talk about medications. You can try Chantix, you can try Ziban, there's quit smoking groups you can go to there's hotlines, there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit. This is really important.",od,,

I'll let you know when I'm ready. We can talk about it. But here now today, I'm here to talk about my blood clots.",cd,,
831,40_8,T,"Well, we're on the same page then because that's exactly why I'm talking to you about quitting smoking, because smoking is a major risk factor for DVT. Even if you even if we treat you now if you don't quit smoking, I'm afraid the blood clots will return again.",irq,,

837,40_14,T,Talking about smoking with me as hard for you.,irq,,

846,40_23,P,"I always thought that the blood clots came from my mother. Hello, like passed down like genetics. I didn't know that smoking could cause this. I just thought that blood clots ran in my family. I guess I also didn't get how dangerous this clotting can be. ",id,,
847,40_24,T,You seem surprised and a little more aware now of the smoking risks?,yq,,
848,40_25,P,I guess so. Yes.,op,,
849,40_26,T,"So Maria, I'd like to get a better sense of what you think about smoking. So on a scale of one to 10 with one being, you don't think it is at all important that you quit and 10 being you're ready to quit today? Where would you put yourself?",irq,,
850,40_27,P,"Well, if you had asked me when I first came in, I would have said less than one. But now I would have to say four ",id,,
851,40_28,T,Why Four and not a lower number.,irq,,
852,40_29,P,That's a good question. Let me think about it.,id,,
853,40_30,P,I guess it's a four because of the blood clots. The blood clots are really heavy on my mind right now.,id,,

867,40_44,P,"Well, the only reason I said are two is that I tried quitting smoking when I was pregnant with Santhi and they are both. I went for two months without a cigarette with Dale. And I didn't make it past that. And that was really mad at myself for that. I really wanted to quit from my babies and I failed. I guess. I'm just hopeless.

1096,72_3,T,"Again, the year bench record this week is the last last week. It was like, kind of squeaky clean. So how's it been feeling? I'm sure it does. It really does. Yeah. It's been really a process. So that's fantastic. What? Tell me about what's been going on this week?",irq,,
1097,72_4,P,I had a good conversation.,ack,id,
1098,72_5,P,"Yes, I feel good. ",id,,
1099,72_6,T,Tell me about it.,irq,,
1100,72_7,P,"I just talked with her on the phone. And yeah, it just went really well. And we actually, after that we had a Skype meeting, a Skype meeting last night. Yes, it was. And, yeah, caught up a little bit and kind of talked about some things.",id,,
1101,72_8,T,"Great. Yeah. Oh, nice. Nice. happy to hear about that. And then I don't remember I'm trying to think from last time, like any Allen updates or Yeah, nice things going, Okay, good. I'm happy to hear that. And then I guess the other thing that I wanted to, you know, talk with you about I know that we, you know, kind of had mentioned it briefly. But today kind of marks the kind of beginning of that kind of final phase for us like so then over the next, you know, three sessions, we're going to be starting to kind of wrap up our work together. And I've been feeling that way too, because it's like, it's hard to, it's hard to want to bring that up, because it's really, it's been really just great working with you. And so I really don't want to see that come to an end. But I thought one of the things that's really important is maybe just to get us starting to talk about and again, we don't have to do it all today but just at least get a starting to talk about, you know, some of the changes that you've made, things that have gone really well for you. And really maybe kind of recap like how it is that you've gone from like almost like binge eating daily to almost now you're not at all and kind of, maybe we can kind of talk about how that's gone. Because I think the other thing that's really important is not only the things that you've done in terms of like, how things have gotten better for you, but I also want us to start thinking about to like, okay, what's going to happen when we, you know, kind of get to the end of our work together and, you know, beyond so like in terms of like, how will kind of how you will kind of keep the work going. And so, I've kind of thought, you know, like, I feel like, I'm kind of being like a wet blanket here. You've had a really great week, and now I'm bringing up our kind of departure. But I think it's really important to kind of mark that mark that transition, and also to market to by having, you know, things go so well. I think it's really important. So I guess the first thing I want to talk about is, I guess I'm pointing my my pad of paper because it's like it's so filled with just all the different things that have occurred for you, you know, over the last several weeks, and I think the first thing that's really notable to me is I really, really appreciated your willingness to engage your mom because I know that that's been so hard for you. And it's been so painful, you know, the way that she's treated you in the past. But that you know, I guess I'm even getting kind of emotional talking about because it just been so rich, the transition you've made in terms of the way you've engaged in a more genuine way and allowed her kind of back into your life and it seems like that that's been, you know, really vital to your you know, like getting better.  So what what's you know, in terms of like, from your perspective, kind of what's that been like for you? ",irq,gc,
1102,72_9,P,Yeah. It's kind of emotionally and it feels good.,ack,id,
1103,72_10,P,It's nice not butting heads with her cuz,id,,
1104,72_11,T,"I'm sure like, ",gc,,
1105,72_12,P,"you want like, I want a good relationship with my mom. I don't I don't choose purposefully to not have a good relationship with her. Yeah, it feels really good. I feel like I can have better relationships, other places as well now because that's healthy.",gc,,
1106,72_13,T,"Right. Right money. And also to I think along with that, is that kind of the strategies, I think that you've, you know, my hunch would be is that some of the strategies that you've used, engage your mom in a more meaningful way have really kind of come in handy in some respects in terms of like, some of the other relationships that you've had, you know, especially, I know that you and Kathy have gotten closer, and even the fact that you've allowed yourself to kind of, you know, connect with somebody else, like, you know, with Alan, you know, I know you were talking with me the other day about some other friends that you've, you know, met and people that you've really got a little bit closer to so that's been really exciting. Yeah,",gc,,
1107,72_14,P,yeah. Yeah. Just get to not go home and feel terrible. Right.,ack,gc,
1108,72_15,T,"Yeah. Yeah. So then, then, kind of from, from your perspective, again, you know, we'll talk more about this in, you know, as you mean, I realize I'm kind of putting you on the spot, but as you've kind of thought about or thinking about it. Maybe you can think about it. To even from now on to the next couple of sessions, but just starting to think about like, what is it that you've really done that you really feel like has been really, that's really helped you make changes in the way in which you've, you know, managed your food or your binge eating.",ack,gc,
1109,72_16,P,"I mean, just really trying to be more positive in my relationships and being more open and communicating, not keeping things in Sofia, like, when I kept things in it kind of bubble up. And that's what made me want to do something that made me feel better. And I yeah, I mean, like, something bothers me, like, immediately express it,",gc,,
1110,72_17,T,"bro. No, I've noticed that as well. And it seems like that that's been one of the important things that you've done. It's really helped, you know, with the changes that you've made. What else feels like that? I mean, you know, I mean, obviously, that's been really important, but what are the other things that you've noticed in terms of like, you know, how it's been going",gc,irq,
1111,72_18,P,"I feel better about myself. And, like not having comments from my mom anymore and having a guy in my life who really likes how I love. Yeah. And yeah, just yet feeling happier with myself.",id,,
1112,72_19,T,"grades are good. No, you know, things like, like we're really in a good space. And I think the other thing too, I was aware of that we, you know, that you'd mentioned to me in particular last time was that and I didn't get a chance to talk with you as much about it. So I think we had so much to talk about last session, but I was really struck by the fact that you It seems like you haven't been as body conscious as you have been in the past. And I didn't know if you've if you've noticed that.",gc,,
1113,72_20,P,"Yeah, no, I feel like I've known like a little bit. Notice that Yeah. Especially that you bring it up. It's true,",ack,gc,
1114,72_21,T,"right? Yeah. Cuz I know like initially and even like, there have been times even along the way. When you'll make, like, you know, I didn't feel like it looked very good, or I felt like something felt really tight on me or, you know, I just felt like that other people were looking at me or maybe judging me, but it seems like that, that as we've kind of moved along that there's really been I've really noticed a real kind of a little bit of a shift in the way in which you've kind of been regarding yourself. And it seems like it's been a little bit different",gc,,
1115,72_22,P,"in that hearing, like, any comments, all my mom about any of that stuff, right. I feel like I've gotten to the point where I'm not concerned like that. I'm going to hear a comment. Right.",gc,,
1116,72_23,T,"Okay, but so I'm going to go ahead and make you talk about it anyway. But what did you do in order to be able to get those comments, though, to stop? Because obviously, I think you did something really significant with her. Yes.",irq,orq,
1117,72_24,P,"I mean, I thought about what you said about really acknowledging that that put a lot of pain on me and Justin Lee, and I know I was able to let her know that and is hired scared to tell her that I mean, she recognized that. Yeah. And yeah, she kind of explained how she thought that she was helping me or she wanted me to have a lot of friends in high school. And that's what she, I mean, she kind of said, like her mom said the same thing to her.",od,,
1118,72_25,T,"Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, and that's really not uncommon when you have, you know, it's funny that just even like, not, you know, like, big, big research had, but it seems like that that's pretty consistent, that, you know, kind of, like, you know, mothers to daughters who become mothers to daughters, like sometimes it's kind of what we call this intergenerational transmission of like, you know, kind of criticality about, you know, shape and weight and, and, you know, some, you know, really proud of you that you, you know, kind of had the courage to address it with her directly and just let her know how you feel because, you know, I think, you know, as a parent, I know that you owe it Like, you know, I always want to try to do the right thing, you know, and I always, you know, I don't purposely want to inflict pain on my children, even though my daughters would suggest that I probably do. But in general, I don't. That's not my goal is to be, you know, harsh and critical. In fact, I really was, you know, try to really be helpful. And I think most parents try to do the right thing. But I, and I think maybe your mom just didn't realize the degree to which that really bothered you and how much that hurt. And in many respects, how much that kind of really drove you to, you know, really, you know, take it out on yourself, so to speak. And so for you to have the courage to bring that up, I think was really helpful. Yeah, yeah. So I really think that that made a lot of differences, as well as, you know, kind of reaching out to others and again, in just the open expression of your feelings, so yeah. So yeah, I think the things that we're doing like now, I think I'd really like to see us kind of continue to, you know, obviously, you still are doing a lot of really good work in terms of like the things that you're talking about and, but yet, I'm also aware that you know, as we're over the next couple sessions, we kind of keep doing a few of these things kind of wrapping up. And then our last session we can more or less, kind of formally, you know, say goodbye and talk about kind of like what the next steps are and, you know, some things you might want to be paying attention to or things you might want to, you know, be mindful of, but we'll get there so yeah. ",gc,,
1119,72_26,P,Great. Thankyou,gt,,
1120,75_0,T,Does the feeling itself of not being prepared interfere with preparing?,irq,,
1121,75_1,P,"Yes, it's really hard. So like when I'm in the middle of being worried, I'm it's really hard for me to focus. So I can't focus on like what I need to do. Because I feel like my mind is on a lot of different things and I can't focus on you know exactly what I should be doing. It's just like, I'm worried about You know, all the different aspects.",id,,
1122,75_2,T,"Alright, so your ability to concentrate and do the hard work of preparing is affected",crq,,
1123,75_3,P,"Yeah, it's like focus my energy on the right things. I'm just like wasting time worrying.",cd,,
1124,75_4,T,"Alright, so this excessive worrying and all this interfering of preparing all this goes on right up until you're getting ready to present",crq,,
1125,75_5,P,Yeah. And then like while I'm presenting,op,,
1126,75_6,T,so let's talk about that let's go into the actual day a present so we have a successive work coming in it's interfering with your ability but it's distressing for you.,crq,,
1127,75_7,P,Yeah.,op,,
1128,75_8,T,Now these presentations are in class? ,irq,,
1129,75_9,P,Yeah,id,,
1130,75_10,T,So it's you're in you're in the classroom. Do you write the only one to present in that classroom is it rotate through several PV?,irq,,
1131,75_11,P,"It depends on the presentation. Sometimes there's like one or two other people that have to present that night, depending on like how long the topic is.",id,,
1132,75_12,T,"All right, well, let's choose the last time you presented that classes as a template. What was the order to go in there?",irq,,
1133,75_13,P,"Well, the one that I really messed up, I think in that I was first But usually, like, I'm like, second maybe.",id,,
1134,75_14,T,"Okay. So for this example, let's say you're through the second. Okay, so you're sitting in the classroom and another student is presenting. What's going through mind that?",irq,,
1135,75_15,P,"I feel like I am totally zoned out. Like I'm not even paying attention to what that person saying, because I'm so worried about how I'm gonna mess it up. You know, I'm, I'm starting to like be sweaty, like my hands are clammy, my heart started to race a little bit, and I'm just totally zoned out on what they're doing. Just, you know, worrying about what's gonna happen when I get up there.",id,,
1136,75_16,T,"So in that moment as you're seated, you're not really watching their presentation as much because you have these strong or somewhat strong physical symptoms. You have your heart racing a bit is sweaty palms. You're zoned out. Have you ever felt the need desire to, like, run out of the room?",id,,
1137,75_17,P,Yes. It's funny you should say that was a little bit hesitant to mention that but I kind of I do I feel like I need to find excuse to like use the bathroom or I just need to get out of there.,op,,
1138,75_18,T,"Yeah, so what do you feel is most pressuring you to leave the room like what? What symptom?",irq,,
1139,75_19,P,"Um,",gc,,
1140,75_20,T,"And what thoughts are going through your mind right then like, so let's take that kind of severe moment. When you're, you're, let's just say still before the presentation, okay? So you're sitting at the desk and your heart rates elevated. And you're not focusing on what they're doing. You're zoned out your anxieties high. What was going through your mind right, then?",irq,,
1141,75_21,P,"I think I'm thinking, like, I'm gonna bomb this anyway. So I might as well just, you know, not go through the stress of having to do it. Like I've already in my head, I know that it's going to end badly.",id,,
1142,75_22,T,So you've already failed.,crq,,
1143,75_23,P,"right. So there's no sense in getting up there. And maybe if I don't get up there, you know, I guess it couldn't be any worse. So I might as well just leave",cd,,
1144,75_24,T,Are you embarrassed that the professor or Other students will see that you were really anxious?,yq,,
1145,75_25,P,"Yeah, I don't want I figure if I leave and people won't, will just make me think I was sick or whatever. And it'll be a better situation, if I just left then happened to see me up there, you know, sweating and all these other symptoms that I have when I actually get up there, it would be better just to leave before that starts.",op,,
1146,75_26,T,"Okay. So, so better to be thought ill and had to leave because you're saying. ",crq,,
1147,75_27,P,"Yeah, or have them wonder what happened then to just be up in front of everybody, you know,",cd,,
1148,75_28,T,to have a severe anxiety for that buddy. And then they can very embarrassing. That would be a very undesirable outcome for you.,crq,,
1149,75_29,P,Right.,cd,,
1150,75_30,T,"So as you're debating that thought, because that's coming to your head, and you're thinking I just need to, yeah, gotta get out here. What happens there, so we're maybe What, 15 minutes before we present? So tell me about that. So you have that thought you want to flee,",irq,,
1151,75_31,P,"right. And I'm looking at the clock and saying, you know, like, how much more time in this presentation before I have to go like, should I go? Should I not go? What are the consequences of running out? You know, and kind of playing out, which would be worse?",id,,
1152,75_32,T,Have you ever had to run out?,yq,,
1153,75_33,P,"Um, once I went to the bathroom to try to, like calm myself down or talk to myself, or you know, like, Cool off my face. Um, but I came back",op,,
1154,75_34,T,"and you presented then you presented Alright, so you you survived. One of the more stressful presentations",crq,,
1155,75_35,P,"Yeah, I almost felt like I was gonna be ill. I was so stressed that day.",cd,,
1156,75_36,T,"That was very, very tough on you. What happened on that particular day?",irq,,
1157,75_37,P,"So typically, like, I go to load my presentation, at this point, like, I have my new cards or whatever, in front of me. I am like, shaking at this point. I am so I don't know if it's scared, or worried or maybe a combination of everything. And I'm just like sweating. My heart is racing. Like I almost feel dizzy. I'm just so stressed out about what's going to happen. And then you know, I'm starting to speak. And then the presentations are usually like 20 minutes or so. Okay, so I have to stay up there for the duration and I'm just like, you know, sweating and then I'm wondering like, are people looking at me or people? Can people see it? You know, am I going to forget something?",id,,
1158,75_38,T,"So the some of the thoughts are you wonder if they can see how anxious you are you wonder if you're gonna do poorly on the presentation,",crq,,
1159,75_39,P,"right. Or they think I've been lazy and I didn't prepare, are they going to think that, you know, I'm dumb or I don't know, you know what I'm doing.",cd,,
1160,75_40,T,"So they might, they might think less of you as a person.",crq,,
1161,75_41,P,Right. Or like be judging me. Okay.,cd,,
1162,75_42,T,Yeah. So there's a number of concerns that kind of going through your mind in that moment. So when does this start to turn around so you start presenting is 20 minutes you initially get up there and get your presentation up on the The projection monitor. Yeah. When does it start to turn the corner?,id,,
1163,75_43,P,"Um, it's depends sometimes I settled down a little bit, but then usually like that, I get some sort of rhythm I think. And then, but then it gets anxiety again until I get my grades. Do you know what I mean? And I'm like, until, because I feel like I'm gonna do poorly. Until that happens when",id,,
1164,75_44,T,when you receive the grades.,crq,,
1165,75_45,P,"Sometimes, like she usually doesn't give them that day but like often like the next day or the day after",cd,,
1166,75_46,T,So does that intense anxiety that you're having while you're presenting last all the way?,yq,,
1167,75_47,P,now? It definitely like dissipates once I can like go sit down.,on,,
1168,75_48,T,"Okay, so so the sort of next big drop off for symptoms would be when you're done with  the presentation",crq,,
1169,75_49,P,"Yeah, when eyes are maybe no longer on me. They've moved on to somebody else. So I figured like, okay, they forgot about me. I'm safe.",cd,,
1170,75_50,T,"All right, then. But then there's this other worry of now we have to see what the grades are right?",yq,,
1171,75_51,P,And I convince myself that I did poorly.,id,,
1172,75_52,T,So the thought is going through your mind is I'm gonna receive a bad grade.,yq,,
1173,75_53,P,"Yeah, and that everyone saw me, you know, sweating and all these symptoms that I have everyone is judging me",op,,
1174,81_0,T,"Well, how can I help you today? ",irq,,
1175,81_1,P,I'm exhausted and shattered the whole time. And I'm fed up. I'd like you to do something.,id,,
1176,81_2,T,And how long has this been going on for?,irq,,
1177,81_3,P,"about six months, and I've been in loads of times, I've seen lots of different doctors. I've had scans and blood tests that you name it, and nobody can find out that they will. Nobody can see there isn't anything wrong with me. The last doctor I saw, so it was all in my mind. ",id,,
1178,81_4,T,I see. Perhaps we can start by getting a fairer understanding of what's been happening. What is the main problem for you?,irq,,
1179,81_5,P,I feel exhausted the whole time and I can't get anything done. Work is becoming a problem.,id,,
1180,81_6,T," I Understand, and what sort of work do you do?",irq,,
1181,81_7,P,I work as a computer programmer. Luckily I can work from home a lot of the time because I find it difficult to get up in the morning.,id,,
1182,81_8,T,And how's your sleep?,irq,,
1183,81_9,P,"sort of okay, but then I I toss and turn all night and. And I feel terrible in the morning. So you don't find sleep very refreshing, but no, it makes it worse. If anything. I wake up feeling awful then late wake up really late and not often after 11:11am ",id,,
1184,81_10,T,do you get sleepy in the daytime?,yq,,
1185,81_11,P,"Yes, I do. Because I get so tired. I often need to take a rest or a nap during the day.",op,,
1186,81_12,T,Are there any other physical symptoms that are causing you problems at the moment?,irq,,
1187,81_13,P,"My muscles ache quite a lot. My legs, my arms, my back. All over. Really.",id,,
1188,81_14,T,muscle aches all over your body. any symptoms?,irq,,
1189,81_15,P,I get a lot of sore throats. And I think there might be some kind of infection running around my system.,id,,
1190,81_16,T,You feel that there's an infection running through your system?,crq,,
1191,81_17,P,Yes. And why else would I feel so ill all the time.,op,,
1192,81_18,T,I see. Is there any other reason you think your symptoms might be caused through an infection?,ack,,
1193,81_19,P,"Well, it all started when I had a really bad dose of the flu.",id,,
