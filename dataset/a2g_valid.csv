132_7,P,"Yeah, I think that'll be good because then also in the morning, I'll remember it's the morning and having these thoughts I need to do this.",yna,id,1.0,5
132_8,T,"There are a lot of places we're going to go. As we talk about CBT and how it relates to what you're going through. I don't want to put too much on you at one time. So I'm kind of deliberately not going to a long explanation, the theory and not assigned A lot of homework, the homework is an important part of it. Okay? And one that I feel is in the best interest of clients to really take seriously and make a best effort to do. Okay. So, I'd like that to be one of the, you know, if you're okay with it, that'd be one homework steps, and the other one. So just just be two things for this week. So that self talk in the morning, and the other one was, is really just starting to cultivate an awareness in the day of when you're having these automatic thoughts. So these automatic thoughts proceed. feelings, and behaviors that you don't like, like feeling worried. So they're a little hard to pick up at first, because you're already having the feeling before you even think, to think about the thought, if that makes sense. And there's a few steps But you're already having the feeling of worry. And now I'm asking you to stop in that moment and try to recover the thought that led to that. Yeah. So that's not an easy request, satisfied to starting out with just try to bring up an awareness of that. If you can, I think super helpful, the best way is to write it down, if it's safe to do so. And if you can't, okay. So perhaps sometime today, you find yourself extra worried. And then you think back to what was going through your mind. And you find it was worrying about the welfare of the family, like a thought like, oh, they're not doing so well. Just don't judge the thought. Just write down. I was thinking to the family that might not be doing so well.",id,,,0
132_9,P,Okay. What should I do with it? Should I like write it on a sticky note and get rid of it? Should I keep it in a journal or?,ack,crq,,6
132_10,T,"Good question. I would say keep in touch. journal, okay, and bring it in. To the extent you're comfortable talking about, we can go over. Okay. And we'll try to together develop self talk to address that. Okay. So we're going to build, we're going to build an inventory of adaptive responses. Okay. Does that make sense? Do you have any questions about or concerns about today in common we talked about?",id,yq,,0
132_11,P,"No, I mean, I think it was really helpful. I just had to remember to, you know, kind of combat things in the morning and then as the day goes by, if I notice any other thoughts, just write it down and everything. I can do that.",yna,id,,5
132_12,T,"I think that would be a great start. And we'll set up a time for down here for another point for next week. We'll get that all situated. But I want to Close just by letting you know, kind of my impressions from on this first session. Okay. I know you have worries, and I am working on understanding them with the family and the decision you made and I can certainly appreciate it's it's a struggle for you. At the same time I see somebody very conscientious. No, you're, you're very concerned about the work you do. You're concerned about the people you're act with. compassionate, empathetic. I see a lot of strength in terms of your ability to understand these concepts I'm talking about and apply them in your life. So I want you to take away from this I hope you take away from this, that you should be helpful. I feel like you have a lot of positive characteristics and strengths that you Bring to overcome the struggle, and I think you'll be stronger as a result of working to overcome. Does that resonate with you? How do you think of yourself?",id,irq,,0
132_13,P,"Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I've worked a lot to help other people. So I think I probably do have the ability to help myself as well. And I also believe that, you know, if I do the work, then in the future, when stuff makes me stressed out, I might be a little better at handling it.",id,,1.0,0
132_14,T,"Yeah, so I hope that you'll be able to overcome what's going on now. But also build a skill set that you can use to overcome new challenges, because you'll face new ones.

77_0,T,any other evidence that points toward you being imposter?,irq,,,1
77_1,P,Besides My bad grade? Not a whole lot.,id,on,1.0,0
77_2,T,Right. So to be safe to say that a lot of that thought of I'm not good enough is kind of based on your feelings of anxiety.,cr,,,8
77_3,P,Yeah. Which are really intense like panic almost in the moment.,yna,cd,,5
77_4,T,Yeah so in a way you're believing With the anxiety will lead you to believe.,cr,,,8
77_5,P,"Yeah, definitely. ",yna,cd,,5
77_6,T,"But in the bright light of scrutiny, there are a lot of facts to support the worst case, which is you don't deserve it. How about evidence that refutes that you're not good enough?",id,irq,,0
77_7,P,"I would say that, you know, I was accepted into the program. Like there's kind of like, a pretty rigorous sort of testing and stuff, which I passed, to get interviews and such to get into the program. So I did that. Like I said, I'm a pretty good student, all considering, you know, before this kind of flick was happening.",id,,1.0,0
77_8,T,"Okay, so you've got through a rigorous process to become a student You're doing well. You mentioned before, just the one bad grade right? Okay, so if you have friends in this program, right, if one of them came to you with this, this balance of, you know, one bad grade and some anxiety, yeah, versus passing, you know, rigorous standards and doing well, otherwise, what advice would you give them?",id,irq,,0
77_9,P,"I mean, now that you're kind of like talking about it, like, you know, this or that sort of thing. It makes sense. I would probably say that, well, you seem to be doing pretty well so far. You know, that anyone evaluating would look at all of the cumulative how you're doing your performance, rather than that one grade",id,,1.0,0
77_10,T,would you feel comfortable giving advice to yourself?,irq,,,1
77_11,P,"I think I tried to sometimes, but my anxiety symptoms kind of like really, like you were saying, your anxiety tells you sort of I think I can think that but I think my anxiety symptoms are such in the moment that it's really hard. You know, and I'm replaying what happened before in my head anticipation predicting will happen again.",id,,,0
77_12,T,"So, so let's look at the the thought and the feeling. If you had to rate the percent that you believed this thought, this belief that you are not good enough to be in the program, like right now right now, yeah, but here with me. How much of your mind believes that that's true?",irq,,,1
77_13,P,"I would say like, you know, a two or three like not very, I don't believe it very much right now because You know, I'm not presenting and it's just you and I not like a group full of people. So that pressure is not there here.",id,,1.0,0
77_14,T,So right now you're really not buying the idea that you're not good enough.,irq,,,1
77_15,P,"Yeah, that is correct ",yna,cd,,5
77_16,T,"So now let's move to let's say right in the near the end of presentation when that anxiety is there, and the classmates that could be looking at you, it could be negatively evaluating you because you're worried about how much do you believe that thought then?",irq,,,1
77_17,P,"I don't feel really confident. In that moment. It feels very real. Like, like any moment, they're gonna kick me out. Like, I'm just not doing well. I'm stuffing.",id,,,0
77_18,T,"Yeah. really intense. So would you think that you were a more accurate evaluator of what's true or not. Now, or when you're in that state of anxiety,",irq,,,1
77_19,P,"definitely now that anxiety that, you know, heart rate and sweating is not there.",id,,,0
77_20,T,"So this evaluation, the percent that you believe that true, this evaluation is more accurate?",irq,,,1
77_21,P,"Yes, I think so.",yna,,,5
77_22,T,"And how much time in any given day would you spend kind of in a mood right now, or you can evaluate accurately?",irq,,,1
77_23,P,"I would say, you know, when I'm not at risk of presenting, like, I feel like I spend the majority of my time, like, it's not something I worry about all the time, just leading up to and then mostly that day,",id,,,0
77_24,T,"okay. So the, so you're able to evaluate the way you are now, the vast majority of the time, right? There's a limited amount of time when you're not when there's A lot of motions going through, right? And at those times, you're maybe a little less reliable,",irq,,,1
77_25,P,right. Like my judgment is clouded.,yna,cd,,5
77_26,T,"However, in that moment you still, those thoughts are strong, right? ",ynq,,,4
77_27,P,"Yes, very troubling. ",yna,,,5
77_28,T,"Even though it's a small percentage, it's intense. And you kind of carry that around a little bit.",irq,,,1
