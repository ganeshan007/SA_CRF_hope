0,100_0,T,"Okay, a great job on your homework was really excellent. He listened to the imaginal exposure recording about six times. And you did the exposure, the in vivo exposure of walking around and touching things like doorknobs and other surfaces and objects you normally wouldn't touch both at your house and other places you went, and you sat down on the floor, and you even ate lunch off the floor at your house and at your mom's house. Okay, and no washing, no wash, no, no hand washing, no extra washing. Perfect. Good for you. Okay, so what did you learn from all that? Do you think over the course of the time you've done that?",id,,
1,100_1,P,It just got easier. At the beginning. It was really hard. And I feel like my stats were much higher than the end. So I guess that was what we talked about the,id,,
2,100_2,T,"habituation, habituation, right? Yeah. The fact that when you do something like that, that initially makes you anxious, and you do it repeatedly, especially in for prolonged periods of time. Your anxiety comes down, right? We're just not built to stay in definitely anxious. Okay. You notice any other changes or anything else?",yq,,
3,100_3,P,"I noticed that before doing the exposures, I was really, really anxious. And then it kind of went down, like the anticipatory anxiety that we also discussed.",id,,
4,100_4,T,Right. Did that change by so yesterday?,yq,,
5,100_5,P,Yeah.,op,,
6,100_6,T,"So you're saying you're not only notice that it went down during the exposure, but you started feeling less anxious even approaching instead? Good? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. All right. Good. Okay. All right. So you're doing so well. We're going to take another step up the hierarchy today like we planned, right. Okay. So this is the dog leash day. You bring it? Yeah. Okay, good. All right. We'll get to that later in the session. First, we're going to do some imaginal exposure. Okay? And you remember what the purpose of that is? Why Why are we going to do imaginal exposure?",irq,,
7,100_7,P,That way I can kind of relive a story or a situation that would make me really anxious and eventually deal with the fear consequence of getting sick in my case,id,,
8,100_8,T,"right. So the idea is, this is how we are able to have you have exposure to or sort of a confrontation in imagination with the consequences you fear of touching things that are contaminated and not washing, doing your rituals. Right. Okay, perfect. So did you write the story? ",irq,,
9,100_9,P,I would say like a 70.,id,,
10,100_10,T,Okay. All right. Go ahead and start when you're ready. Should we press play? Thank you for reminding me to start the recording. So you have that for homework. Okay.,id,,
11,100_11,P,"So I'm in my house and the dog starts barking, and I know that that means that I have to take him out. I really don't want to so I'm thinking maybe I should wait until Joe gets home and he can do it. But I know the dog keeps barking, he's gonna wake up the baby. So I decided to go to the front door and get a leash. I'm not going to wear the gloves they usually wear so I feel we experienced touching the leash. But I'm already feeling really anxious. And I look at the leash and I see that it's gross and full of hair and the dog has been biting on it and in probably has saliva and other things and I see stains and Miss test thinking or if that's dog poop and I get sick and I just feel myself shaking and really sweaty. And my heart is beating really fast. So I'm feeling really, really anxious but I push myself and I grab leash, and I get the dog, open the door, go out and grab the leash.",id,,
12,100_12,T,Okay let me now your stress level,irq,,
13,100_13,P,like 90 ,id,,
14,100_14,T,"Okay, you're doing great, just keep going.",id,,
15,100_15,P,"So I grab the leash, and the dog is pulling and I feel the lease kind of pushing through my skin and I'm thinking all the bacteria that's getting there and I'm going to get sick, wanna vomit, but I just keep going. So I walk the dog, come back home, and I just leave the leash in the front door. And I'm thinking, I'm probably going to get sick. I really want to wash my hands. I really want to take a shower. But I try not to and I stopped myself. And I'm feeling really, really anxious. So I can't stop thinking about washing. So I tried to go to bed. Decided to fall asleep. The next morning I wake up, and I already feel sick. I know I'm sick. I'm shivering and I'm, I feel like I have a fever and I'm shaking again and I'm really nauseated. So I go to the bathroom, start vomiting. And I know I'm sick. I already got something I should have washed. I started thinking about that. Going to get the baby sick. And I feel really, really sick.",id,,
16,100_16,T,"Okay, great job. What's your level now?",irq,,
17,100_17,P,Like 80. Okay.,id,,
18,100_18,T,"All right. So just keep visualizing this. I'm going to describe it now. And you just stay with that image as much as you can. So you're in the house and the baby's sleeping and you're trying to get some housework done and do things for dinner. Suddenly, you hear the dog at the front door barking and barking and immediately your heart rate kind of jumps up and you get upset and anxious because you know, that means He needs to go out. And Joe is not going to be home for hours. And you really don't want to take him out. But you have to. And it makes you sick and tired and upset, because you're not going to use the gloves that you always use when you have to take them out. So you walk toward the door, and you think, well, maybe I'll just make them wait. But you realize how wake the baby up if you don't take. So you go toward the leash, and it just makes you even more anxious to see it. And it's dirty. And it's chewed up, and it's gross, and you see stains on it. And you think about what those are from and maybe they're from dog poop and that's going to get on you. And you pick it up anyway and snap it on his collar. And as you go out the door and he lunges outside, he pulls that leash into your hand and you feel the contamination from the leash, entering your body, through the pores of your skin and you feel like it's just running up your arm through your bloodstream. And you keep thinking oh my god, what if I get sick from this What if What if there's some germs in this or bacteria, but you keep walking him until he finishes what he has to do and bring him back inside the house. Take the leash off. And the urge to wash is so powerful, so strong, you want to go scrub your hands and get in the shower and wash your whole body and do it quickly and get all these terms off from the leash. But you don't do that. You know, to make yourself not do the ritual. And then you go back in then just keep doing the housework and keep doing things but that's the sense of feeling sick, is staying with you and worrying about what's going to happen if you picked up germs from the leash. At night you go to sleep, still anxious, still upset about what happened. Wake up in the morning. And then before you have your eyes open even a couple minutes you know that you're sick, you can feel your body being sick, you rush to the bathroom and vomit You can feel the fever and the time your body is just not not right. You're sick. And you know, it's because you handled that lesion didn't wash, you didn't do the washing you needed to do. And now you're sick and the baby will probably get sick. And if only you had done the washing, okay? What's your level now?",id,,
19,100_19,P,Like 80,id,,
20,100_20,T,"Okay. Okay, you take it back and you do it again. Okay. Good job.",id,,
21,100_21,P,"Okay, so, I'm home. The dog starts barking",id,,

35,104_13,T,"okay, but part of the problem is those look deep in like you're going to have significant scars. So my suggestion is in the future if you do it is that you put some sort of bandaid on it to keep it closed. But let's talk about how how this happened. First of all, tell me you were telling me on the phone that you wanted to die? But did you? Was this a suicide attempt? Or do you think was just just a cutting we thinking about killing yourself or wanting to kill yourself or wanting to die? ",irq,,
36,104_14,P,I was thinking about killing myself? I thought you would help me and you didn't. That's what I want to talk about. I want to talk about how it is that my life is not going better and you are not helping me and you're not available to me when I need help.,id,,

All right, Mr. Smith, my main concerns here for scoring are that you've increased your weight at a pace that's a little faster than What normally happens and with it waves, intended notice that because we sleep at night, the extra weights they put on, can actually help and can push your tongue backwards and sort of covering one pipe and then it creates snoring that you've been having. So, if you could imagine you're laying down like this. Okay? And here's your nose and this is where the airflow comes in, to windpipe, okay, here's your mouth, and your tongue just sits like that. Now, sometimes what can happen is that the time So down here in this area that can actually stop the airflow here. So what happens during this reaction to try and get oxygen in? Okay? For this, I would like to run a couple tests to do bottom of it. I will be advising you to go for a sleep study. And I can measure how well you're sleeping and delineates what's happening, what's causing the snoring. Your heart sounds sound good. And because I think it's, it's possible that you may have to also have a heart condition that's related to it. I would like to get an ECG.",id,,

240,132_7,P,"Yeah, I think that'll be good because then also in the morning, I'll remember it's the morning and having these thoughts I need to do this.",op,,1
241,132_8,T,"There are a lot of places we're going to go. As we talk about CBT and how it relates to what you're going through. I don't want to put too much on you at one time. So I'm kind of deliberately not going to a long explanation, the theory and not assigned A lot of homework, the homework is an important part of it. Okay? And one that I feel is in the best interest of clients to really take seriously and make a best effort to do. Okay. So, I'd like that to be one of the, you know, if you're okay with it, that'd be one homework steps, and the other one. So just just be two things for this week. So that self talk in the morning, and the other one was, is really just starting to cultivate an awareness in the day of when you're having these automatic thoughts. So these automatic thoughts proceed. feelings, and behaviors that you don't like, like feeling worried. So they're a little hard to pick up at first, because you're already having the feeling before you even think, to think about the thought, if that makes sense. And there's a few steps But you're already having the feeling of worry. And now I'm asking you to stop in that moment and try to recover the thought that led to that. Yeah. So that's not an easy request, satisfied to starting out with just try to bring up an awareness of that. If you can, I think super helpful, the best way is to write it down, if it's safe to do so. And if you can't, okay. So perhaps sometime today, you find yourself extra worried. And then you think back to what was going through your mind. And you find it was worrying about the welfare of the family, like a thought like, oh, they're not doing so well. Just don't judge the thought. Just write down. I was thinking to the family that might not be doing so well.",id,,
242,132_9,P,Okay. What should I do with it? Should I like write it on a sticky note and get rid of it? Should I keep it in a journal or?,ack,,
243,132_10,T,"Good question. I would say keep in touch. journal, okay, and bring it in. To the extent you're comfortable talking about, we can go over. Okay. And we'll try to together develop self talk to address that. Okay. So we're going to build, we're going to build an inventory of adaptive responses. Okay. Does that make sense? Do you have any questions about or concerns about today in common we talked about?",cd,,
244,132_11,P,"No, I mean, I think it was really helpful. I just had to remember to, you know, kind of combat things in the morning and then as the day goes by, if I notice any other thoughts, just write it down and everything. I can do that.",on,,
245,132_12,T,"I think that would be a great start. And we'll set up a time for down here for another point for next week. We'll get that all situated. But I want to Close just by letting you know, kind of my impressions from on this first session. Okay. I know you have worries, and I am working on understanding them with the family and the decision you made and I can certainly appreciate it's it's a struggle for you. At the same time I see somebody very conscientious. No, you're, you're very concerned about the work you do. You're concerned about the people you're act with. compassionate, empathetic. I see a lot of strength in terms of your ability to understand these concepts I'm talking about and apply them in your life. So I want you to take away from this I hope you take away from this, that you should be helpful. I feel like you have a lot of positive characteristics and strengths that you Bring to overcome the struggle, and I think you'll be stronger as a result of working to overcome. Does that resonate with you? How do you think of yourself?",id,,
246,132_13,P,"Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I've worked a lot to help other people. So I think I probably do have the ability to help myself as well. And I also believe that, you know, if I do the work, then in the future, when stuff makes me stressed out, I might be a little better at handling it.",id,,1
247,132_14,T,"Yeah, so I hope that you'll be able to overcome what's going on now. But also build a skill set that you can use to overcome new challenges, because you'll face new ones. And I want you to be the most prepared you can be I feel like even though you have these worries and anxieties, I want I'd like you to remember you have a lot of strengths. I feel like you can do pretty well with this. So we'll stop there. If You're good and we'll set you up for appointments next week.",id,,

So I'm glad we were able to talk about this, it really seems like you have a good plan going forward. You know, really striving for not drinking alcohol at all.

Usually, as you know, I'm an honor student, I usually am studying over the weekend, my parents told me go out to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. And when I when I got there, like, I'm not used to this like party environment, where everything that you see in the movies is kind of what happens where you have people just drinking out of the bottle or playing random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason. And because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else is doing. So I wouldn't be I wouldn't be ostracized. ",gc, id,-1

I felt like right now is the real time to put the effort in and to put the work in. So I started to step a bit later and take on a bit more work. So my stress levels sort of start to increase over a while. I was drinking a lot more coffee took few caffeine tablets and energy drinks.

What did it mean to be feeling like that kind of more awake and more energized maybe?",gc, irq,0
781,158_15,P,"Yeah, well, for me it was. It was my sort of time. So I spent I spent three years I thought  I was in control I was doing well. I didn't wasn't really part of my life at the time. I didn't really talk to any of my friends about it. But then I yeah, I started to just sort of grow into it.

782,158_16,T,and what you might think that was?,orq,,0
783,158_17,P,"Well, I thought that I was working harder than ever, but it was misjudged, I think and so I, I didn't perform to the best of my ability in when it came to the to the exams, and so I didn't achieve. I didn't achieve a first time and I only got to one.",od, id,0

785,158_19,P,"well, so to the end of the end of university, and that was the time where all as soon as that period stopped of work then I was sort of let off the leash a bit. And yeah, I just thought to grow even further. So I mentioned I was I was taking Ritalin to block coffee and as soon as our exams had stopped, I just substance abuse of took a bit more of a hold. And yeah, I just sort of grew into this person who I thought was him was the guy that everyone wanted to be around and to see and so I made sure that I was just everywhere that could be seen I was.",id,,0
786,158_20,T,"This is like there they got after you finish the exams but before the results are out,",gc,,0
787,158_21,P,"yeah. So we will just scan out a lot, but if not every night ",gc,,0
788,158_22,T,he said that you were taking Ritalin and drinking a lot of coffee.,gc,,0

792,158_26,T,How's that affect you?,irq,,0
793,158_27,P,"I honestly was on cloud nine at the time. And yeah, I was just always the person ever wanted. Everyone wanted to know. In my head.

794,158_28,T,Right.,gc,,0

And so in this sort of role as the man as the man about town I was spent a lot on Yeah, I'll hold drugs close invested in this technology and I was",id,,0
796,158_30,T,so it sounds like it began with kind of the exam pressure and putting more pressure on yourself to stay up using kind of stimulants keep yourself awake. And then you started to feel like you were more and more the man you were you were kind of popular you were successful. How did you respond to and cope with those symptoms? What did you do once those are kind of begun?,gc, id,0
797,158_31,P,"Well, having not had to deal with my illness throughout University and for it not being a part of that world, I I didn't confront those symptoms in a in a way that's gonna have long term stability. And as well, it began with doing the work that I needed to do. That's just, that's just what I needed to do in order to achieve my goals and to achieve what I want to.

798,158_32,T,"So it sounds is on the one hand, you didn't confront it, you kind of just let it roll. And on the other hand, you said that you kind of took it as evidence that you were very energetic, you were powerful. This was all kind of explained about who you were. And I guess how did that affect you looking at things in that way? ",gc, irq,0
799,158_33,P,"It just it was my time.

It was now crystallizing",id,,0
800,158_34,T,"for you on the brink of something, yeah, mess from the sounds of it.  And, again, going back to that kind of beginnings Ah, where you started to stay up late and use stimulants. I mean, how much sleep were you getting at the beginning?",gc, irq,0
801,158_35,P,"They saw it gradually diminished. I think it began at six, five. And was ended up about three and two.",id,,0
802,158_36,T,and what kind of things did you notice? Did you notice any changes from having less and less sleep in your body maybe the way you were thinking.,irq,,0
803,158_37,P,"Think the harder I was working, the faster my brain then will work and how much the harder I work, the more I would do. So it was it wasn't.

He said you're going out a lot you convinced your friend to do this app. Was there anything else that you did that maybe you wouldn't normally do that you think might have been assigned to you that your meat was much higher than you'd like it to be?,gc, irq,0
807,158_41,P,"There was I hide a lot of savings. That my my parents had built up for me, which I probabiliy don't really exist anymore either through the money invested, and through drugs, clothes. I had a girlfriend at the time but because it was because I was the main character, and in a sense, it always was only the only person that matters and so sort of those around me especially, still didn't really have as much importance. So on nights out, I wouldn't. She just wouldn't be in my mind and so that would be Other women. ",id,,0

870,159_58,T,Okay.,gc,,0
871,159_59,P,"But then I just started thinking about it again, right before bad, and just feeling really guilty that I cut. Because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you. And I just I mean, I, the night time I just, I constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like, I mean, you know, it's usually a pretty hard time.",id,,-3

875,159_63,P,No. That always seems to happen.,gc,,-3
876,159_64,T,Sounds like for you cutting works for a little while but it doesn't last?,crq,,0
877,159_65,P,"Yeah, I guess so.",cd,,-1
878,159_66,T,I knew you've also been working on doing less cutting.,gc,,0
879,159_67,P,I've been doing pretty good,gc,,0
880,159_68,T,you have you've been working really hard. I'm just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you won't have those guilty feelings?,gc,,0
881,159_69,P,"Yeah, maybe. I mean, those guilty feelings really suck.",gc,,-3
882,159_70,T,"Okay, so with the cutting it sounds like the point where you decided to cut out your locker. what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim.",gc,,0
883,159_71,P,"Yeah, cuz she's stupid.",gc,,-3
884,159_72,T,"Okay, it sounds like you're also already having a pretty bad day. You said he hadn't called. He hadn't been texting us. And that was on your mind?",gc, yp,0
885,159_73,P,Yeah. That's right.,op,,0
886,159_74,T,"So I'm wondering if that point, if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting.",gc,,0
887,159_75,P,Okay,gc,,0
888,159_76,T,that'll bring that anger from a nine down a little bit.,gc,,0
889,159_77,P,"It's not going to bring it down all the way to a three, though. I'll tell you that much.",gc,,-3
890,159_78,T,It might not. But it'll bring it down a little bit. Maybe each thing you try brings it down a little bit more.,gc,,0
891,159_79,P,All right,gc,,0
892,159_80,T,maybe there'll be things will feel good about later. You won't have to worry about that guilty feeling coming back.,gc,,0
893,159_81,P,All right.,gc,,0
894,159_82,T,"So the first thing is that pencil, it sounds like it's comforting to have it. ",gc,,0
895,159_83,P,"Yeah, it is.",gc,,0
896,159_84,T,"It also sounds like it's tempting, What do you think about that?",gc,orq,0
897,159_85,P,"I mean, Only if I am in the mood to cut it's tempting",od,,-3
898,159_86,T,having that pencil is going to make it harder to try other things. When you've been talking about how you're really committed to not cutting any more or cutting less,gc,,0
899,159_87,P,"Yeah, I am.",gc,,0
900,159_88,T,Sounds like that pencils standing in your way.,gc,,0
901,159_89,P,"Yeah, maybe.",gc,,0
902,159_90,T,"What do you think about getting rid of the pencil this time, choosing a different favorite pencil that maybe you can't cut with. ",orq,,0
903,159_91,P,"I mean, maybe only, only if it's can be like a really cool pencil",od,,0
904,159_92,T,That way you can still have something that can be your favorite but which won't tempt you. That'll make it easier to try the two things.,gc, id,0

914,159_102,T,"That sounds like a good option. That's our goal is to keep pushing, cutting further down the list, and keep adding things that you're going to try first. And you're right that the first thing you try, it might not bring you all the way down to a two or three, but it might bring you down a little bit. And each thing you try might bring you down just a little bit more. So you have to be willing to try a few things. Can you do that?",gc, id,0

939,172_4,T,"Okay, so there's a few things going on there. You said you feeling stuck? Not happy. And some sound like a little confused as to what's going on what's causing it. You have any suspicions about what might be causing?",gc, irq,0
940,172_5,P,"I mean, I've been feeling like really isolated lately. You know, because I'm a stay at home mom. It's hard. There's not a lot of people. You know, right at my fingertips to spend my time with, you know, obviously my family but, um, so I guess, you know, I kind of I had some friends in the neighborhood, but like, our friendships just kind of fizzled out. And I ever since then it's just like, I don't really feel like doing much. I just kind of feel like what's the point and let my husband take care of a lot of stuff. You know, I used to, you know, shop for the groceries all the time and make sure the house is always stocked and make dinner every night and get the kids ready for school in the morning and I still do that stuff. But a lot of times, you know, I let it slide. Sometimes I won't make dinner or whatever. And when I do do it, I just feel like I'm forcing myself to do it. The passion is gone.",id,,-1
941,172_6,T,"And how long have you been? You say housewife, right? How long, you've been the housewife?",irq,,0
942,172_7,P,"For a long time, I have two boys. They're eight and 10 and I've been staying home since my first one was born. So 10 years and you know, it's it's been really rewarding for me I'm not really interested in going back to work or anything like that. Because I know people always say you're, you know, you're feeling unfulfilled, like you should go back to work, but it's not it. You know, I've felt happy with it for so long. I don't think that it's being home. I think it's some thing inside of me.",id,,-1
943,172_8,T,"something's changed. So for a long time, you were satisfied in housewife, you enjoyed that life or found satisfaction out of life. And somewhere along the line, something changed in you. And now you're not happy with it. So what it represents in terms of activities like caring for your children and shopping? No, that's what changed.",gc, irq,0
944,172_9,P,"Yeah, exactly. Well, I guess, you know, my youngest is eight. So he's only been in school for a couple of years. So I guess like, it's not super recent, but recently he, I finally have no children in the home. So it's more, it's more time to myself. And I kind of fill that gap a little bit with other things. Like I did Cub Scouts with the boys for a while. And like I said, I had some friends around the neighborhood so that kind of like, fill that time. But now that stuff, it's just not really happening anymore. So now I kind of feel like it's not it's not boredom, you know, it's not like I don't have enough to do. It's like, I don't want to do anything. But then at the same time, I feel frustrated because there's nothing to do.",ack, id,-1
945,172_10,T,"So you're, you're frustrated with your situation, maybe with yourself a little bit.",crq,,0
946,172_11,P,"Yeah, I think a lot more with myself because I know That I would feel better if I, you know, maybe found more friends or found something to do with my time, but I don't want to at the same time, so I'm frustrated with myself because I know I kind of know what would help but then I don't really have the like the volition to do it.",cd,,-1

948,172_13,P,"Yeah,I'm not motivated. ",id,,-3
949,172_14,T,Have you received any feedback from other people about this meaning? Has anyone else noticed that you're down?,irq,,0
950,172_15,P,"Yeah, I mean, obviously, my husband has noticed because he has to get the boys ready in the morning. He's really supportive. I know he can tell that I'm not feeling the same. But you know, he works. And then he has to come home and pick up my slack. So he's getting frustrated, which I understand. And, you know, my mom has said to me that, you know, she thinks I'm not doing as much and so it kind of hurts. It feels like everybody's trying to tell me I'm lazy and then I'm not doing enough and it's always that like feeling, you know, like nobody really understands how much work that goes into being a mother, but then at the same time now that I'm doing less and less, I feel like they're all right. You know, I am lazy. I'm not doing anything",id,,-1
951,172_16,T,they used the word lazy.,yq,,0
952,172_17,P,"No, no, not that I can remember. I, you know, I think my mom said, like, you're not doing as much as you used to and I kind of took offense to that, even though it's kind of true. It's like, I don't know. It hurt. ",on,,-3
953,172_18,T,"Okay, that was painful for you. What about what your husband said? ",gc, irq,0
954,172_19,P,"You know, I think at first we didn't really acknowledge it. It was like, you know, I took a break here. He picked up the slack and it was fine, but now that it's been and more he's kind of getting frustrated and, you know, he's been asking me about how I feel and why I'm not doing as much but at the same time, like, even though he knows that I'm not motivated, it's still frustrating because I, it's my responsibility. So I think he's, you know, he's been saying, like, I need you to do more around the house pretty much is what he said, I need you to do more.",id,,-1
955,172_20,T,"What was your response to that? When I said, I need you to more?",irq,,0
956,172_21,P,"I started crying because I know he's right and that's what I tell myself every day, I need to do more, but I don't have the motivation to do it. And so I'm so frustrated with myself. And, you know, I know that he needs that from me and I don't know why I'm not motivated to do it.",id,,-1
957,172_22,T,"Okay, so you're frustrated forfeeling down? ",crq,,0
958,172_23,P,Yeah,cd,,-1
959,172_24,T,And you're frustrated for lacking motivation?,crq,,0
960,172_25,P,Hmm,cd,,0
961,172_26,T,"And just as little as a few years ago, you didn't feel it this way at all?",irq,,0
962,172_27,P,"Yeah. Yeah, I actually think, you know, I've been feeling this way more like in the past, like six months or something like that, like I, it was hard for me when my youngest son went to school but more in like the natural way that it is hard. But this is something else this is more consuming. It's, you know, like the difficulty of him going away to school, almost was motivating, like it was hard, but at the same time, it was freeing because I had other opportunities to do stuff. This is just like stunting.",id,,-1
963,172_28,T,"Okay, so I'm gonna shift gears a little bit. Can you tell me about your well, a recent day? So it's kind of typical what you're telling me now meaning not motivated down?",gc, irq,0
964,172_29,P,"Sure. Onn Wednesday, I was having a really hard time getting out of bed. So my husband just got the kids ready in the morning and I felt really bad about that. So I just stayed in bed for a couple more hours, probably until like 1030. And I got up you know, I'm made myself something to eat. And then I thought, you know, I should probably go to the store because we're almost out of milk. And, you know, and I think the boys need shampoo, but I just, I just sat down and I just sat there and I think I sat for I don't even know how long the boys came home from school. It was like, you know, 330 and I hadn't even gotten up. And so then I said, Okay, the boys are home. I should probably get started on dinner soon, because my husband will be home soon. And I found I found something in the fridge to make and I made dinner and you know, after that everybody, you know, just sat down, we just watch TV and I just sat there until it was time to go to bed.",id,,-1
965,172_30,T,This is you said this was recently right?,crq,,0
966,172_31,P,Ummhuhh,cd,,0
967,172_32,T,What would the ideal day of look like take that same day and do you wish you could have done?,irq,,0
968,172_33,P,"I wish that I would wake up and you know, I would want to wake up when it was time for the kids to get ready to school to go to school. You know, I could make sure that everything that they had everything they needed, I could pay for lunches and get the boys dressed and you know, check they needed any permission slip sign, that kind of thing. Send them out the door and then I would see if we needed anything from the store. I probably do a little bit of cleaning around the house. I used to like have like a list of chores that like I would do different things on different days and different days of the month and stuff. So like bedding would get washed one day in the week and that kind of thing. So I would probably like follow that list. Nowadays I just, you know if it gets done, it gets done and usually my husband helps me with some of the stuff and you know, I would do the bathrooms one day a week that probably gets done like once a month now. But um, I would do that so do the cleaning. If we if I needed to go to the story we do that. I get ready for the boys to come home I'd probably make them a snack and and figure out what was going to be for dinner, I would go ahead and do that. And then probably, you know, sometimes we we would watch TV after my husband got home after dinner or I would figure out something for us to do, we could play a board game or or watch a movie as a family or something like that. And that would be after the kids did their homework and everything like that. And then after we spent some time together, I put them in a bed.",id,,-1
969,172_34,T,"Alright, so it's a fairly wide discrepancy between where you are in terms of behavior and where you want to be. So let me ask you a very specific question about one of the first things in the day you would mention that when it was time to get up. Right? You did. So you were awake and aware of it, but you went back to sleep. And, of course, your husband got up and he took care of things. ",gc,,0
970,172_35,P,Right.,ack,,0
971,172_36,T,"How did you feel alone Not to happen, because clearly that's not what you want to happen. How did you feel about oversleeping?",irq,,0
972,172_37,P,"I just like, you know, the alarm goes off, and I know it's time to get up and my husband's getting out of bed and I just look at the clock and I think, what's the point and, you know, it's just this instant feeling of I can't even describe it like pointlessness of getting up. And so, I go back to sleep, but I feel worse for doing it. You know, like, it's a catch 22 like, I don't want to wake up, I just don't want to, but then when I go back to sleep, I feel bad. I feel guilty. ",id,,-1
973,172_38,T,"Okay, so I'm not getting up in the time you wanted you feel guilty, but you also mentioned something that you thought, which was, if I'm not mistaken, you said what's the point, can you expand on that?",irq,,0
974,172_39,P,"It just it's just like, you know, when I'm sleeping, I don't realize how sad I am. And I don't realize how hard it is to function. When I'm sleeping. I'm not aware of that as soon as I wake up I am. And so I just have this feeling of like, what's the point of getting up and experiencing these feelings when I could go back to sleep and not have to",id,,-1
975,172_40,T,What's the point of getting up when sleeping pain at back?,irq,,0
976,172_41,P,"Yes, yeah. ",id,,0
977,172_42,T,"Okay. But then, when you when you do get up, you feel sad and guilty about having overslept.",irq,,0
978,172_43,P,"Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.",id,,-1
979,172_44,T,"So really, functionally, what you're doing is you're delaying experiencing the pain.",gc,,0
980,172_45,P,yeah,ack,,0
981,172_46,T,"And then in terms of how it affects your relationships and your family, you're not getting your kids off to school. Your husband's getting real frustrated. ",gc,,0
982,172_47,P,yeah,ack,,0
983,172_48,T,"And all you've really bought yourself is a couple extra hours sleep. And you know, presumably without without pain because you're sleeping, but you're not really escaping it. Does that make sense? ",gc, yq,0
984,172_49,P,Yeah.,op,,0
985,172_50,T,"Before when you felt more satisfaction and purpose, did you get up and help the kids off to school?",irq,,0
986,172_51,P,"Yeah, it was so easy. I would just like, you know, I would wake up and, and I would be like, Okay, it's time to get up and get out of bed and get ready to go. I mean, you know, sometimes if, if, if I was a little bit tired, it would be a little bit harder. You know, it's not, you know, as a stay at home mom, I usually get enough sleep for the most part now that the kids are older and everything, so it's not usually too hard to get up and I would, I would, you know, it would be another good day, you know, I would be glad to get up and take care of the things that I needed to take care of and I felt accomplished.",id,,-1
987,172_52,T,"So maybe what's going on here? Or maybe maybe we could help you remember, you know, over the last few sessions, we've talked about cognitive behavioral therapy and different techniques that I'll be using and different things we're talking about, sometimes with behavior, the behavior that's useful, which in this case, I'm assuming we can agree is the getting up on time. behavior that's useful has to come first, even if the feeling doesn't match. Right. So sleeping those extra I presume you a couple hours delays you from feeling sad, but it causes other problems. If you were to get up one time, you might still feel sad, right? Because that's why you're over sleeping, as you're sleeping longer to avoid that. But the functional part of being a housewife, as you identify would be completed. So maybe some of those feelings of sadness and guilt would over time abate. Because functionally speaking, you're completing the tasks that you want. What's tough about that, So in the moment, it's easy for me to say this now. But in the moment, like for instance, when you have to get out of bed tomorrow, you're going to be facing that same challenge, which is I can get up now and feel depressed, or I can wait and feel depressed later. So in that moment, it's hard to act on the behavior that you kind of know you want to move towards. I mean, it sounds like you want to get up and ",gc, irq,0
988,172_53,P,"yeah, I mean, I want everything to be normal again. And I guess I never really thought of it like that. Like, I just thought, Well, if I'm waking up at the right time, and I'm just feeling bad then like, like I said, What's the point, but I guess it makes sense. Like, even if I don't feel like doing it, maybe it'll make me feel better if I do do it, even if it's hard, because nothing is really harder than when I'm already going through.",id,,-1
989,172_54,T,"Well, it seems like you're, you're more or less making things worse, right? In an effort to avoid the pain that you're going to suffer anyway. You're making the pain worse, and just delaying it a little bit, right. What what thought and we talked before about automatic thoughts, these thoughts that come up when your belief system meets these different situations that occur when you have the thought that this is pointless. Right, and I'm going to expand on my thought a little and say that, you know that thoughts really getting at is I can avoid this pain if I sleep a little while longer. That's a version of the thought.",gc, irq,0
990,172_55,P,"Does that make sense? And also, I guess I thought that, no, it wouldn't really be that beneficial to get up. ",id,,0
991,172_56,T,Okay. So minimizing the benefit.,gc,,0
992,172_57,P,Yeah.,ack,,0
993,172_58,T,"So there's a couple of things going on, right? I can avoid the pain by slipping in. And there's really no point to getting out because I won't do any good anyway. ",gc,,0
994,172_59,P,Yeah.,ack,,0
995,172_60,T,"What adaptive response is that self talk, we talked about those things we consciously think to ourselves, could you apply in that moment when you're, you know, whatever time you get up in the morning, when you're thinking about this, that thought comes in that it doesn't really matter if I get up anyway.",gc, cv,0
996,172_61,P,"I mean, I guess I could tell myself like I can do this. Like Instead of, you know, when I say to myself, what's the point instead I can say, I can do this? I can get out of it. It'll be okay. I can. I'm strong enough, even though it's hard to push through the pain and get up now, even though I don't want to, I can say I can do this. ",cd,,-1
997,172_62,T,"Okay. So that would be adaptive response. I'm strong enough. I can get through this, but it will be difficult. Right? How about the value of getting up early and seeing the kids off to school. The automatic thought right now is telling you that's not valuable. But I think that you believe it is valuable.",gc, irq,0
998,172_63,P,"Yeah, I mean, I know it's valuable. I guess what my frustration is, is that I know it's valuable and it used to give me like an emotional payoff of like, pride and, and satisfaction and now I'm not getting that anymore. So I guess I need to realize that even though I'm not getting it right now. If I keep trying, maybe it will happen again, because it did happen before,",id,,-1
999,172_64,T,"it will seem logical that you have higher probability of getting that back. If you do get up, then if you guess that's true, right? ",irq,,0
1000,172_65,P,"So never get the satisfaction of sending my kids off to school by never send my kids off to school,",id,,-1
1001,172_66,T,she had a zero percent chance of successful successfully moving past this was asleep again and you have some other probability greater than zero if you if you do.,gc,,0
1002,172_67,P,I never thought about it like that.,gc,,-1
1003,172_68,T,That kind of makes sense?,yq,,0
1004,172_69,P,"Yeah, yeah.",op,,0
1005,172_70,T,"So even though getting up early is going to be painful and seem like not a practical move. Logically, you know, that has a better chance of paying off for you and I think that with with these type of, what you're going through is probably depression. Right now what I like to talk to you further, to make sure that's what's going on seems like you're depressed, and sometimes with depression, you just have to get one thing going your way each day. Right? So, so I'm not saying necessarily tomorrow, you have to get up one time, and then go make new friends and then go find social activities, right? You don't have to build Rome in a day here. Right? It's, it's more like, Can I do this one thing? Okay, I proved to myself, just what I'm saying, which is I'm strong enough to get up. See the kids often have that one victory for tomorrow. Right and build on that. ",gc, id,0
1006,172_71,P,Yeah. Yeah.,ack,,0
1007,172_72,T,"And part of that's going to be playing those adaptive responses back, right thinking of those thoughts. Whether it's just thinking them, you know, in your mind or actually thinking them and saying, sometimes it's helpful just to say them out loud,",gc,,0
1008,172_73,P,"Not letting the negative thoughts take over because that's what I'm thinking like, okay, I can get the kids off to school, but after that, I'm going to start thinking You know, what's the point again? Like, what? Why don't I just sit down, there's just no point. So if I can keep reminding myself that I just have to try, and that I did accomplish something, and then, you know, even though it's hard, and I know that those thoughts are going to come back, and then I'm going to feel bad. If I don't do anything, I'm not going to feel any better.",gc, id,0
1009,172_74,T,"So you have a good handle on the adaptive responses sounds like right. And you know what you have to say after but you know, what you want to do. I'll see again in a week, and there'll be five days in there between now and my see again, we will have to decide they want to get up as your kids off to school or not, right. So I want you to give that a tryto adaptive responses and try to push through with that behavior. Now it's important to keep in mind that we have five days between now I want to see you again in five business days, right? school days, and you may not succeed every day. And that's okay. Right?",gc, id,0
1010,172_75,P,hmmm,ack,,0
1011,172_76,T,"Sometimes the setbacks like you could, you could get up early two days in a row and then it goes up back up third day, don't let that will wash away those successes. It's a day by day fight, try not to think of it in terms of the week, I want you to try to think of it in terms of what I have to do today. Not worrying about the future, and not worrying about should done in the past. ",gc, id,0
1012,172_77,P,Okay,ack,,0
1013,172_78,T,"The only moment we really can live in is now. So try to stay in present the moment recite those adaptive responses, and try to push for that just that one victory. Okay, can you try that?",gc, cv,0
1014,172_79,P,"yeah, I think I can try that.",cd,,0
1015,172_80,T,"All right. So work on that and To continue with the homework, that maybe the CBT homework haven't given you and I'll see you next week. ",gc,,0

1019,176_1,P,"Yeah, I just then recently I've just been feeling down a lot. And I can't really like snap out of it. Like sometimes if it's happened before, I can just like, get myself back on track. But recently, I've just found it really difficult to do it. ",id,,-1

1022,176_4,T,"You've had low mood in the past, but it's kind of you've been able to pull yourself out of it before but more recently, you found that harder. Okay, so I understand that you you first went to your GP he referred you here about two months ago. And can I ask what what led you to go to the GP in the first place?",gc, irq,0
1023,176_5,P,and my long term boyfriend broke up with me and it was such a shock like I really wasn't expecting it. And it's got me really down and felt really lonely and and I didn't really want to see people and she wanted a baby in space and the mom told me I should probably go to the doctors and and he is her family to you.,id,,-1
1024,176_6,T,"Okay, so it sounds like you had that breakup and you weren't expecting it. So kind of came out of the blue a bit and, and that you've been on your own quite a lot. So you're not been seeing people as much and it sounds like your mom, notice that there's been a bit of a change in you. Okay, and how things been then since then, since that happened and since you went to the GP?",gc, irq,0
1025,176_7,P,"I just nothing's really changed, nothing's really improved. I feel down like absence and feel distant from things and like I said, I can't stop all over.",gc,,-3
1026,176_8,T,"Okay, and how did you feel about coming here today? ",irq,,0
1027,176_9,P,"And I was kind of disappointed in myself, because I feel like maybe else my ages doing this, like, I should have been able to snap out of it. Like, it's just another thing that I've not really affects me make me stand out for the wrong reasons.",id,,-1
1028,176_10,T,"Okay, so you feel like it's kind of odd or unusual to be here, coming to see a clinical psychologist, I suppose I just want to reassure you that it's absolutely normal to have feelings of depression and anxiety. It's really very common, and it certainly isn't auto strange at all. So it sounds like it was actually quite hard for you to come here today. So what I guess led you to do that because it sounds like maybe there was a lot pushing you against coming here today, but you've managed to come anyway. ",gc, id,0
1029,176_11,P,"And I'm just hoping that it's going to help. I think I didn't I didn't really want to admit it, because like it's just another failure. But my mom was talking to me and, and she's, she's not really happy with the way I'm behaving and I don't really want to disappoint her again. And so I thought there's no harm in  this",gc, id,-1
1030,176_12,T,So sounds like partly you're doing it then your mum because you're a bit worried that she she isn't pleased with you at the moment.,crq,,0
1031,176_13,P,Yeah.,cd,,0
1032,176_14,T,"Okay. And I think it's great that you've come here. And definitely there's a lot of evidence to suggest that psychological therapy can help depression and particularly the type of therapy that we're going to be doing, which is called cognitive behavior therapy. And I'll tell you a bit more about that as we go on, but I'm just trying to find out a bit more about you today. So I saw from your notes that your medic student",gc, yq,0
1033,176_15,P,"Yeah, and not currently in the Unii room and but yeah, last year as a medical student,",on,,-1
1034,176_16,T,"okay, so I guess what, why, what's, what's the reason that you're not in uni this year?",irq,,0
1035,176_17,P,and I Like he is pretty tall fast as a then suggested I took a year out. This is the Break.,id,,-1
1036,176_18,T,"Okay, so just thinking that would be about six months ago was it that your ear out started, and it sounds then maybe like your first year was also quite tough.",gc, irq,0
1037,176_19,P,"Yeah, was that I thought we still for everyone, but obviously we'll take it in different ways daily.",id,,-1
1038,176_20,T,And you're planning on the panning on returning.,crq,,0
1039,176_21,P,And yeah I am gonna have to really so. Yeah,cd,,0
1040,176_22,T,don't sound too sure about that though?,irq,,0
1041,176_23,P,"I think return is probably that's what's gonna make everyone happy. And I think you know, at least I'll be able to finally achieve something and get something right. So yeah, like next year, I'm going to get through it. Yeah. ",id,,-1
1042,176_24,T,"Okay, so it doesn't, it doesn't sound like you want to go back.",crq,,0
1043,176_25,P,"I do. And I do. Enjoy it, I just I just don't feel like mate the main man and I just, it's a lot of flack and a lot of pressure and but that's what comes with it and, you know, it'll work out for the best if I go.",cd,,-1
1044,176_26,T,"Okay, so I guess in there's quite a lot of thoughts and feelings about going back at the moment.  And I'm just wondering In the meantime, what are you what are you up to what have you been doing?",gc, irq,0
1045,176_27,P,"And I've not really had much on the horizon men more men, have friends owns a restaurant. And like she suggested that did a better way to sit in there. Just deliver a bit like money and stuff because I've seen that in Uni. So, you know, I've done that.",gc,,-1
1046,176_28,T,"Okay, how many shifts have you done there?",irq,,0
1047,176_29,P,"And I've only done one so far. And yeah, I don't know whether it's something that I'd probably go back to but ",id,,-1
1048,176_30,T,okay. How when was that shift?,irq,,0
1049,176_31,P,It was last week actually.,id,,0
1050,176_32,T,"Okay, and how was it, I suppose I'm intrigued. Can you tell me a bit more about that? ",irq,,0
1051,176_33,P,"Umm it was, it was different, you know, because it was like I could. I did enjoy it because there's like, it's just different aspects and I had to like, speak to people and like, try to get their orders and try to remember it and stuff. Like, I wasn't very good. But I suppose like it was handy to have some money and, like, get out of the house.",id,,-1
1052,176_34,T,So it sounds like you quite enjoyed that then?,crq,,0
1053,176_35,P,Yeah.,cd,,0
1054,176_36,T,And what makes you think you weren't very good?,irq,,0
1055,176_37,P,"I just I just bit slow and people sometimes they didn't stand by science, so I'd have to talk louder or quieter or slower and a bit confused sometimes with the orders. And then just don't really think that I'm not really like a friendly. Like, people don't really think that I'm a friendly person. They didn't really want to talk to me and stuff. I felt like I was like inconveniencing them by like, asking them things and getting things wrong. But yeah, they said they said that apparently and most people got like a few mistakes on the fascia. But then again, she's my mom's friend so probably why she's saying it.",id,,-1
1056,176_38,T,So the person who owns the restaurant is your mom's friend.,crq,,0
1057,176_39,P,Yeah.,cd,,0
1058,176_40,T,"Okay, so it says you're saying that you think you weren't very good that's because you're a bit slow and you got confused with some orders. ",gc,,0
1059,176_41,P,Yeah.,ack,,0
1060,176_42,T,"Is it? You said it's common for people to do that. Well, on that first shift, that's a she said toes,",crq,,0
1061,176_43,P,"but and, but it's probably just, she's just trying to make me feel better she probably felt sorry for me because I'm obviously not very good at it. Like, I'm not very good for any things recently. I think she just felt sorry for me.",cd,,-1
1062,176_44,T,"Okay, so I've just been noting down some of those thoughts that you've been having. You kind of So you feel like you're not very good, you're slow. You're confused with the orders and you feel like you're inconveniencing her and she feels sorry for you. And I suppose I'm wondering I mean what makes you think that she feels sorry for you?",gc, irq,0
1063,176_45,P,"Like, like such as my mother's friends and she's obviously feeling sorry for my mom as well because she's got a daughter it's not like anyone else who harried and she's just like all alone and she's not getting involved so I think she just feel sorry for me and she doesn't want to extend until upset me. Yeah.",id,,-1
1064,176_46,T,"When you're having these kind of thoughts, because that's quite a lot of negative thoughts you're describing how do you feel?",irq,,0
1065,176_47,P,"I feel empty. I do. I'm just calling as it is and just call it as reality. And I feel like I'm being honest with myself by just leasing it and not trying to get around tighten it because No, I can see myself",id,,-1
1066,176_48,T,"so it sounds like you feel like these thoughts are very true then. I mean, if you're going to write them, so I'm going to pick out some of those thoughts you describe. You said, I'm not very good and I'm inconveniencing them. How much would you say you believe those on a scale out of 100? where 100 is like I absolutely believe it and zeros like I don't believe it at all.",gc, irq,0
1067,176_49,P,About 80,id,,-1
1068,176_50,T,"so you feel quite sure that you definitely believe okay. And you said that when you're thinking those thoughts, she started to feel quite empty.",gc,,0
1069,176_51,P,"I just feel just, like sad. I'm not really myself. I just like it's like I'm not really bad, but when I am coming through Good job, and",gc,,-1

1074,176_56,T,Did you have butterflies that night when you're at the restaurant?,yq,,0
1075,176_57,P,"Yeah, I was pretty nervous then. But when I got into it, they went away and like, it just talked to me for a bit. And so obviously, I realized that I wasn't doing a very good job.",op,,-1
1076,176_58,T,"Okay, and when you When you have these emotions, how does it affect your energy levels? Do you feel more energetic, less energetic or about the same?",irq,,0
1077,176_59,P,i am feeling down,id,,-1
1078,176_60,T,Yeah. And when you're having those emotions that you were describing,gc,,0
1079,176_61,P,"I feel drained like, then you will have like the energy to wake up in the morning sometimes, because y'll play less and less than the body's having and I don't want to.",id,,-1
1080,176_62,T,"Yeah, sounds like you feel very tired. You're struggling to wake up. You said it's pointless. And then what do you do then when you feel like that? So I guess you just talked about when you wake up in the morning, and you feel heavy, and I suppose you've been maybe having some of these thoughts and those emotions, potentially the night before? What do you then do? How do you respond to that?",gc, irq,0
1081,176_63,P,I just have to go expose that don't really have a choice because my mom I live with my mom and I know it's hard for her. So I don't want her to be too worried. So I just I just tried to carry on as normal girl takes longer and I don't want to but I do. So now its my routine.,id,,-1
1082,176_64,T,So you're a bit slower and gets getting up.,crq,,0
1083,176_65,P,Yeah.,cd,,0
1084,176_66,T,But you are still getting up anyway. And what about your kind of what do you think about when you're doing that?,gc, irq,0
1085,176_67,P,"I'm just thinking that nobody else is like mate my age like, maybe we should be feeling like this. And I'm the only one that does.",id,,-1
1086,176_68,T,"So it sounds like you think a bit more about the problem and you kind of spend time thinking about hey, how can it hapen to me?",gc, orq,0
1087,176_69,P,"I don't, I don't want to feel like this but i do and nobody else I know doors. So it makes me feel even more alone gets me even more down. I just don't display anyone and I should have anyone to it.",od,,-1
1088,176_70,T,"Okay, so it sounds like you try and toughen up on yourself a little bit. Tell yourself to work harder to be different. Okay. And when you start telling yourself that kind of thing and how does that make you feel? Does that make you feel better afterwards or worse?",gc, irq,0
1089,176_71,P,"feels worse because it still can't snap out of it. Like, I'm aware it's happening and I just, I'm trying but I just can't. And then and then it's just another thing that I'm feeling. Just another thing that I can't really get",id,,-1

1097,185_7,P,"Well, I've heard stuff about them that I don't really need them and they're not going to do much for me and just kind of absolutely go out and get them. So I don't really use them for that reason.",od,,0

1100,185_10,T,"Okay. Okay. So Chris, it's okay if I share with you some of the things that I've learned about condom usage and some of the things that my clients that are around your age have shared with me about condom usage. ",crq,,0
1101,185_11,P,"Yeah, that's fine. ",cd,,0
1102,185_12,T,"Okay. What some people don't realize and don't know about condoms is that may not only prevent help prevent teen pregnancy, but they can also prevent sexually transmitted infections like Flaminia along with HIV. They're really effective in preventing these things. And there's also a lot of easy ways to get condoms these days that some people don't know, the local health departments have condoms and many times they're free. And local pharmacies, drug stores have condoms. And there are a lot of clinics that have them as well either for a small fee or sometimes they're actually free. And there's some some ways to that people have found carrying them around pretty conveniently, you know, in their car or in their pockets because they're pretty small. What does it sound like? As I'm talking what what are what are some thoughts that are going, going through your mind?",id, irq,0
1103,185_13,P,"Definitely changing my mind about condoms a little bit, think there's no hurt and just carrying them with me. And if they do protect against all that stuff that you said, that sounds a lot better than what I have heard. I definitely want to avoid all those consequences. ",id,,0
1104,185_14,T,Okay. Yeah. You're not interested in becoming a father right now I'm guessing.,crq,,0
1105,185_15,P,Yeah.,cd,,0
1106,185_16,T,"Okay. Okay. Great. Well, can I ask you? So after this conversation today on a scale of zero to 10, with zero being that it's not at all important to you and 10 being that it's extremely important? Where do you think you fall with how important you know taking a chance on using condoms would be to you now?",irq,,0

1120,186_5,P,Yes.,cd,,0
1121,186_6,T,And she sent you for a blood test.,crq,,0
1122,186_7,P,"That's right, doctor. ",cd,,0
1123,186_8,T,"Yeah, we think he might be anemic. ",gc,,0
1124,186_9,P,Oh gosh. Yes.,gc,,-2
1125,186_10,T,"What I want to do today was firstly to give you a blood test result. And then talk to you a little bit about the condition of anemia, and then talk about some potential treatments. ",id,,0
1126,186_11,P,So right up to dear.,gc,,0
1127,186_12,T,Does that sound okay with you?,yq,,0
1128,186_13,P,"That sounds fine. Yes, doctor. ",op,,0
1129,186_14,T,"Great. So should we have a look at your blood test? Yes. Yeah. Here it is. So what we're testing for is the level of hemoglobin in your blood, right and just to show you the normal range for Women is between 11.5 and 16 grams per deciliter of hemoglobin, right? And this is your level of hemoglobin. It's 8.7. ",id,,0
1130,186_15,P,All that slows.,gc,,0
1131,186_16,T,"It's a bit lower than we would like. So what we're looking to do is to get that back within the normal range, right. Just  to reassure you iron deficiency anemia, which I think you've got is fairly common, up to around 15% of women can experience this type of anemia. ",id,,0
1132,186_17,P,Right.,ack,,0
1133,186_18,T,And it's very treatable as well. Yeah.,id,,0
1134,186_19,P,"Yeah. Oh, yes. I mean, this tightness, so it's just just getting me down doctor. ",ack, gc,0
1135,186_20,T,"I must be, because you've got quite a busy lifestyle.",gc,,0
1136,186_21,P,"Yes, yeah. And I just can't cope with it. ",gc,,0
1137,186_22,T,Okay. Yeah. Shall I tell you a bit more about anemia? Do you know anything about the condition?,yq,,0
1138,186_23,P,"I don't know. I mean, I've heard of it, but I don't know what it is.",on,,0
1139,186_24,T,"It is the condition relates to your blood right. Within your blood there's several components, one of which is plasma. Within the plasma you have your red blood cells. And within that you have a protein called hemoglobin which carries the oxygen around your body to all the different organs. Okay? Now if that's not working efficiently, you start to experience the kind of symptoms that you've been having like breathlessness. dizziness, tiredness.",id,,0
1140,186_25,P,"Yeah, definitely. Yes. ",gc,,0
1141,186_26,T,One of the causes can be blood loss. So I wondered about your periods. How are they?,gc, irq,0
1142,186_27,P,"Well, they've been heavy these last few months really heavier. I pass it down to my age, you know, this stuff getting irregular and heavy. And, but you might be right.",id,,0
1143,186_28,T,"Yeah, that may be a fact. Yeah. Yeah. So I want to talk to you about treatments. Now. There are a couple of things that I would suggest that you try. The first thing we'd like to do is to increase the amount of iron in your diet. Can you tell me a bit about the sort of diet you have at the moment?",gc, irq,0
1144,186_29,P,"So I mean, I'm really busy and I think they have a reasonable, you know, well balanced diet. We eat a lot of ready meals. And then on a weekend we always have a good breakfast it was cooked bacon bowties so so I think it's quite good diet rightYes ",id,,0
1145,186_30,T,teenage children they keep you busy.,yq,,0
1146,186_31,P,"Oh they do. Yes. I mean, you know it's like having a taxi service you know what with that and and then at work you know so busy at work it just just so tired. I'm just getting tired ",op,,0
1147,186_32,T,It must be hard for you to do all those things.,yq,,0
1148,186_33,P,"Yes. Yeah, it's difficult. I just feel yourself can't cope anymore. ",op,,-3
1149,186_34,T,yeah. Now you mentioned ready meals. I can understand you relying on those for convenience. But the problem is sometimes you don't get the proper balance of nutrients.,gc,,0
1150,186_35,P,All right doctor,gc,,0
1151,186_36,T,So what I'd ask you to do is perhaps to adapt your diet slightly and include more iron rich foods in your diet.,crq,,0
1152,186_37,P,"Oh, right. Okay.",cd,,0
1153,186_38,T,"Before I tell you about what some of those foods are, can ask if you're a vegetarian.",yq,,0
1154,186_39,P,No No,on,,0
1155,186_40,T,"You know, the reason I asked that is because one of the best sources of iron in your Diet is lean red meat.",gc,,0
1156,186_41,P,"Oh, yes. Yeah, you're nice day.",gc,,0
1157,186_42,T,"Yeah, exactly. Also liver is a good source of iron. ",gc,,0
1158,186_43,P,"No, no, no, no couldn't eat liver.",gc,,-2
1159,186_44,T,What about something like steak that you mentioned? Would you consider eating that a bit more regularly?,irq,,0
1160,186_45,P,"Well, yes. I mean state one day to Kaku toll, you know, because now to go good. Yes. Yeah. ",id,,0
1161,186_46,T,"There's also leafy green vegetables, things like kale and spinach, a good source of iron. ",gc,,0
1162,186_47,P,"Ohh the kids wouldn't eat that. But, I mean, they like sweet corn so they can have the sweet conch and they were the same and I could go for the leafy green vegetables. Broccoli, so there's broccoli? ",gc,,0
1163,186_48,T,"Yes. Yeah, I like broccoli. You know, ",gc,,0
1164,186_49,P,"Ohh good, good I would go with that.",gc,,0
1165,186_50,T,There's other things too. You might want to consider things like fortified cereals which have iron. And,crq,,0
1166,186_51,P,what are those?,crq,,0
1167,186_52,T,"Well, if you look on the ingredients, panel, cereals, you'll see some are enriched with iron so you could perhaps incorporate some of those. ",cd,,0
1168,186_53,P,"Oh, yes, yes, ill Look in the supermarket. I mean, I've got some of those. We could have a tweak and and that gives me more time to cook or die ",cd,,0
1169,186_54,T,could make your life a bit easier.,gc,,0
1170,186_55,P,"Yeah, definitely I would be happy to vote yes,",gc,,0
1171,186_56,T,white bread is a good source of iron as well.,gc,,0
1172,186_57,P,"Yes. Yeah. No, they only like white bread only buy white bread, but I could buy myself some brown bread. cobs and have it for lunch. Yes. Yeah. No good. ",gc,,0
1173,186_58,T,So do you think you could give some of those things a try?,orq,,0
1174,186_59,P,Yeah. I would try doctor definitely,od,,0
1175,186_60,T,"right. Yeah, it's the other thing I'd like you to consider is taking a course of iron tablets.",crq,,0
1176,186_61,P,"Oh, I'm not into tablets. Why? ",crq,,0

1349,194_47,P,"I'm okay with that. You know, when mom was sick, you know, she was in hospice care. So she had cancer. And the nurses and the doctors, you know, had our family talk to someone you know about what we were feeling. You know,",gc,,-1

1351,194_49,P,"Yeah. Yeah. To talk to someone that understood what we were going through, sure.",cd,,-1
1352,194_50,T,Something else might be exercise another possibility would be a natural product or some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate.

1353,194_51,P,"Maybe something natural exercise, oh, heavy energy. I don't want to I just don't feel like doing anything. So no, I'm not going to exercise right now. But if it's something that's natural, you know, I can maybe try that.",gc,,-1

1360,194_58,T,Six or seven? Why a six or seven and not a four or five?,irq,,0
1361,194_59,P,"Well, because I don't want to stay like this. And, you know, I've already talked to her before. She was really nice. So I wouldn't mind going back to her and she told me you know, when I saw her last time, if I ever needed I could come back",id,,1
1362,194_60,T,So it sounds like you've got a connection there already. That's really good. Does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that?,gc, yq,0

1382,194_80,T,"Let's talk a little bit more about that Your say on a scale, if we can do another one of those scales, zero being confident that you could start an exercise program.

Some things kind of stand out for me and hearing you talk about what's been happening and your feelings I can appreciate. It's really painful.

1413,2_9,P,"I mean, I guess it's like, quantitatively the same as before. I do the same things with families. But now I kind of feel like I can't trust my own judgment like everything. Before everything just kind of felt a little more black and white, and now it just feels like everything is so much a shade of gray that I just can't tell. You know what's right and what's wrong anymore.

And now I just feel like there's all these doubts in my head and all these questions about if I'm doing the right thing.",id,,
1416,2_12,T,"All right. So you're looking inward, you're looking at yourself a lot of self doubt. Now you're looking at decisions as much more difficult. It's much more difficult to come to the right decision. And second guessing sounds like move to second guessing a bit. When you do make a decision, like playing over over your mind.

1527,213_29,P,Mm hmm.,ack,,
1528,213_30,T,What do I mean?,irq,,
1529,213_31,P,"Instead of wanting to turn and run away from the fear of eating this, and just, you know, check out basically, you want me to go towards it, and, you know, just experience what I'm feeling and not go away from it. ",id,,
1530,213_32,T,"Right, exactly. So, you know, fears associated with that urge, like you said, to run out the door. So instead of running out the door, we want you to approach the thing that's scary, which is this cheesecake right now. Right? ",yq,,
1531,213_33,P,Right.,ack,,
1532,213_34,T,"Okay. So I see how hard it is. For you and I, honestly, it's hard for me to watch and I wish I could just take that away. But as you know, the reason opposite action is so important is if you if I just take that fear away by saying no more cheesecake, it's just gonna make you more fearful The next time you come in front of some kind of food, that's tougher for you",od,,
1533,213_35,P,Yeah it makes it worse.,on,,
1534,213_36,T,"Yeah. So by doing this, hopefully over time, your fear will go down. Okay. So can we have the fear right now And still take a few more bites?",yq,,
1535,213_37,P,Okay,ack,,
1536,213_38,T,All right. Okay. Let's do it. So how was that?,orq,,
1537,213_39,P,This is difficult,od,,
1538,213_40,T,"Yeah, I can see how difficult it is.",gc,,
1539,213_41,P,"But I'm doing it, but its difficult. ",od,,
1540,213_42,T,Exactly.,ack,,
1541,213_43,P,Doesn't feel comfortable.,on,,
1542,213_44,T,"No, I wouldn't imagine it would. But you did perfect opposite action right there, which is you are feeling really uncomfortable and I can tell that, but you still did it. ",od,,
1543,213_45,P,Right.,ack,,
1544,213_46,T,Do you feel a little bit proud of yourself?,irq,,
1545,213_47,P,"Yeah. Yeah, a little bit.",ack,,
1546,213_48,T,Okay. So this shows me that you can do it. So let's try again. Let's take a breath. And then we'll go back and do more opposite action.,irq,,
1547,23_0,T,"So, alright, let's take a step back and talk about competency. What education Did you need for the job you have now?",irq,,
1548,23_1,P,I have my bachelor's degree. And we got a little bit of training. You know every so often we get some training at work and stuff like that.,id,,
1549,23_2,T,Are you evaluated at work by anybody to see if you're in a job you should be?,yq,,
1550,23_3,P,"Yeah, I have a supervisor so they check up on stuff and also like if I feel like I have questions and stuff like that, I can go to them as well.",op,,
1551,23_4,T,Have you been Found in that system to be somebody who's satisfying the requirements of in terms of competency satisfy the requirements of employee.,yq,,
1552,23_5,P,"Yeah, I mean, I haven't been fired. So that's a good sign again,",op,,1
1553,23_6,T,"that's a good sign. Yeah, you haven't been fired. Have you ever had any type of write up or somebody discussing something with you?",yq,,
1554,23_7,P,"No, I just I kind of feel like maybe the climate has changed a little bit at the office after this happened, like maybe other people think I didn't make the right decision. I guess maybe that's part of where all my doubts are coming from, like, no one has said to me and I have, you know, my supervisor hasn't called me in and said, I'm concerned about this, but I just feel like maybe  other people think that I did something wrong.",on,,
1555,23_8,T,"Alright, so there's no there's no evidence supporting that. In a kind of a direct fashion, like a supervisor coming to, but there's no other evidence supporting it based on your, what you're feeling, how you're perceiving things. Yeah, you're getting this feeling that, by the way, they're interacting with you.",crq,,
1556,23_9,P,"Yeah. Which, I guess maybe I shouldn't be that freaked out about because there have been other people who have made mistakes and like, the supervisors have talked to them and, you know, even then they didn't lose their jobs. So it's not like, you know, I, you know, I don't know, I guess it's not like just hearing them, or thinking that they're judging me is an indication that something terrible is going to happen or that I made this huge mistake.",id,,
1557,23_10,T,"Alright, so you can see that I'm talking this through you can see that. So some of this could be feelings. Thoughts you're having, combined with what you're actually observing share, you're filtering your observations in a way that's maybe making them seem a little more destructive, or more negative.",id,,
1558,23_11,P,"Yeah, it's kind of like, I know, it's not that big of a deal because, like I said, My supervisor hasn't talked to me and it's not like I've heard anything terrible about anything happening to the kids or anything like that. But I just feel like, you know, I have those thoughts like, oh, was she you know, saying something? You know, when she said that? Did she was she referring to what happened? and stuff like that?",id,,
1559,23_12,T,Can you can you provide an example of an interaction with a coworker where where they said something that you thought maybe was referring back to this?,irq,,
1560,23_13,P,"Yeah. So like we were having like our regular work week. And we kind of like, you know, discuss how things are going. And it's been kind of a big deal what, you know, more so than usual that the kids were removed from this family. So, you know, one of my co workers kind of nudged me and said, like, oh, you're the bulldozer you, you know, you plowed right through that family took those kids away. And, you know, I think she meant it kind of, like as a joke and just, you know, maybe to say, like, you know, you did what you needed to do, but it kind of made me feel like does she think that I'm just callous? Like, does she think that I just didn't care and you get what I'm saying?",id,,-2
1561,23_14,T,"So she referred to as a bulldozer. And one way to take that would be powerful, efficient. Another way to take that would be kind of destructive we talked about before destructive powers. They're mechanical they don't have a lot of feeling.",id,,
1562,23_15,P,Yeah.,ack,,
1563,23_16,T,So you don't know exactly know how she meant it but you're thinking maybe it was negative,id,,
1564,23_17,P,"yeah. And I guess it kind of like goes back to like my fear that I didn't think it through that I kind of just, you know, I made the report and that was that and, you know, it makes me feel like Was I being mechanical? Was I just was I just nonchalant about it? Should I have put more thought into it? And it really, you know, it hit me where it hurt I guess you know.",id,,-1
1565,23_18,T,So her saying that really kind of brought up this thought that maybe you are maybe you are not empathetic enough or compassionate enough.,crq,,
1566,23_19,P,"Or even just thoughtful. I guess maybe I was just being, you know, just going about my job without putting a lot of thought into What I was doing exactly.",cd,,-2
1567,23_20,T,"So, maybe one thing you would have done differently in light of that comment. At the time making a decision, you would have thought through the steps more.",id,,
1568,23_21,P,"Yeah, maybe taking a little bit more time.",ack,,
1569,31_0,T,Tell me about sure for any spiritual beliefs.,irq,,

1572,31_3,P,"Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of do's and don'ts. Our church was very like, hell oriented. Like, if you do this, you're gonna go to hell to do this. We're gonna go to hell and like, well, let's let that's fun.",gc,,
1573,31_4,T,How do you think those spiritual values influence your daily life?,irq,,
1574,31_5,P,"I mean, sometimes I do. Feel guilty about what I do. I feel guilty about, you know, spending more money than I'm willing to admit on drugs and parties, but I mean, I think you know, God forgive me. Hmm.",id,,

And, you know, the fight happens or somebody can't pay the rent or I can't pay the rent. You know, I've moved probably about 12 times within the past year,",id,,

And according to my notes, you were going to look into some yoga classes. You were going to attempt to drink less coffee.

1694,39_3,P,"Well, I looked at the gym and there weren't really any yoga classes, so I didn't I didn't really do that. I did cut back on my coffee a little bit, but I just find that it wakes me up in the morning. So, you know, I've cut back to one cup instead of two cups. And I did take the dog for a walk. But I haven't really gotten out other than that.",id,,
1695,39_4,T,"Okay, so it sounds like you've made some movement forward towards your goals. You did at least look into yoga even though the gym didn't have yoga classes. You did cut down from two cups of coffee to one. And you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk. But it sounds like you had a little bit of an issue. Getting out more with people.",gc,id,
1696,39_5,P,"Yeah, I don't. I don't really like to go out with people. There's usually a lot of a lot of chatter, a lot of talking and it's hard for me to be in.",gc,id,

1699,39_8,T,"Okay, so actually getting out with people actually makes you even more anxious. So I'm wondering what we could do about that.",irq,,
1700,39_9,P,I'm not really sure maybe I could invite people over instead.,id,,

1709,39_18,T,"So when you see the pictures on your newsfeed, it makes you excited about doing it. But when you actually go to do it, it makes it more challenging. ",crq,,
1710,39_19,P,"Well, I haven't done it before. So it's a little bit hard to get out there because I don't think I'm as flexible Other people?",cd,,
1711,39_20,T,Mm hmm. And so you're thinking that you're not as flexible as the other people. I'm wondering if that's what Yoga is about flexibility?,irq,,
1712,39_21,P,"Well, I think I think that people go to become flexible. But I think that maybe some people are already just flexible.",id,,
1713,39_22,T,Mm hmm. So you are concerned that maybe you might not be as flexible as the rest?,irq,,
1714,39_23,P,Yeah.,ack,,
1715,39_24,T,And you'd be a beginner?,irq,,
1716,39_25,P,"Well, I'm worried I wouldn't be able to do the poses in class. ",id,,
1717,39_26,T,Okay. So what do you think would happen if you couldn't do the poses in class?,irq,,
1718,39_27,P,"Well, I feel embarrassed, I think. And then if the teacher tried to get me to do it, and everybody else would see that they're trying to get me into a pose, and I think it would be embarrassing.",id,,
1719,39_28,T,Okay. So you'd be embarrassed if you couldn't do the certain policies. And how would you feel if you could do all the poses in the class,crq,,
1720,39_29,P,I think I feel really good.,cd,,
1721,39_30,T,And so what do you think it is preventing you from not doing all the poses in the class?,irq,,
1722,39_31,P,Right? I guess it's just the embarrassment of maybe not being able to do it.,id,,
1723,39_32,T,What would what would cause you to not being able to do it?,irq,,
1724,39_33,P,The causes are not we're not sure. Okay.,id,,
1725,39_34,T,"I remember when you first came in last week, you told me that when you were younger, you used to be very, very flexible. And I'm wondering, what would make that difference between then and now?",irq,,
1726,39_35,P,"Well, when I was a kid, I used to just practice a stretch a lot, and now that I don't, I don't have the same flexibility. Mm hmm. So as I've gotten older, I've lost a lot of flexibility",id,,
1727,39_36,T,and How would it be if you couldn't do all the poses in the class and you did get embarrassed and you just let it be embarrassed?,irq,,
1728,39_37,P,"I mean, it would be okay. But I don't I don't like that feeling.",id,,
1729,39_38,T,What would be the payoff? Do you think? If you put up with a little bit of embarrassment?,irq,,
1730,39_39,P,"Well, I probably feel really good in the end.",id,,
1731,39_40,T,"You know, I can give you I've lots of studies that I can give you and videos that I can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga and their anxiety went way down. As a matter of fact, some studies show that anxiety, doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications. So I'm not sure if you were if you knew that or not.",gc,id,
1732,39_41,P,"I didn't really know that. I just thought that that you'll go was For about flexibility, I didn't realize there were so many other benefits.",on,od,
1733,39_42,T,Okay. So how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to 10?,irq,,
1734,39_43,P,"Well, I probably, if I thought that I'd be it would make me less anxious, I think I'd probably be around an eight or nine.",id,,
1735,39_44,T,"Good, good. That's a definite improvement. And, and you could determine after that first class, whether your anxiety levels have decreased or not. And that, would that be validation for you? Or would that be? It gives you even more motivation? If your anxiety levels were decreased instantly after the yoga class?",irq,,
1736,39_45,P,I think that would be a lot of motivation to continue.,id,,
1737,39_46,T," Okay. So one other thing that I wanted to, to mention to you was, you said that you'd walk your dog in nature and curious as to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature. Wow.",gc,,
1738,39_47,P,It was only about 30 minutes. It was really cold and windy. So we didn't want to stay out. And by we I mean the dog and I Mm hmm.,gc,id,
1739,39_48,T,"And so because of it, it was cold and windy. You decided to kind of cut the walk short. Yeah. And and that's definitely understandable. I'm wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking the dog in a day.",od,,
1740,39_49,P,Wow. It might help if I take a jacket next time.,gc,,
1741,39_50,T,"Okay, so if you took a jacket in cases cold, yeah. And do you have a special place in nature that makes you feel peaceful, that you could be in that would help you even more. Enjoy it",orq,,
1742,39_51,P,"as long as I'm just away from road noise and traffic and then it's a lot better. Okay, and there's lots of trails around my house like that. Okay,",od,,
1743,39_52,T,excellent. Is It's great that you have trails around your house where you're not exposed to all that noise.,od,,
1744,39_53,P,Probably.,ack,,
1745,39_54,T,And on a scale of one to 10 tell me what that probably means.,irq,,
1746,39_55,P,It's probably attend. I can I can commit to that.,on,id,
1747,39_56,T,"Okay. All right. So it sounds like last week, you had a few problems carrying out the assignments towards decreasing your anxiety. You really couldn't find a yoga class because you're already signed up for a gym that doesn't have the yoga classes. But you already know about the yoga videos that I've sent you so you could actually do them at home.",irq,yq,
1748,39_57,P,"Yeah, ",ack,,
1749,39_58,T,you how strongly do you feel about doing them at home?,irq,,
1750,39_59,P,"If I could do them at home, I would probably do them all the time. Mm hmm. I think that would be a big difference.",id,,
1751,39_60,T," And then there would be no embarrassment factor. If you couldn't do the poses less coffee, you've gone from two cups to one cup that's very good. And get out more with people, you've decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people not knowing who's going to be in your space. That's always an apprehensive moment when you don't know you have no control over who's going to be in your space. And on a scale of one to 10 you think that you could spend at least an hour a day walking with the dog?",irq,,
1752,39_61,P,I think it's a 10. I think I can do them on all four all four.,id,,
1753,39_62,T,Fabulous and how do you think you feel if you were to envision how you would feel incorporating all of these items in your life next week of the course of next week? How much of a difference Do you think it would make you feel?,irq,,
1754,39_63,P,Perfect it maybe even make me look forward to doing these things if I were doing them on a regular basis. Mm hmm.,id,,
1755,39_64,T,And how would it make you feel?,irq,,
1756,39_65,P,It would make me feel really good.,id,,
1757,39_66,T,And so you'd feel relaxed and you would feel more positive and I think you would do.,gt,cd,
1758,39_67,P,Thank you so much.,gt,,
1759,4_0,T,Are you doing today?,gt,,
1760,4_1,P,Good. How you doing?,gt,,
1761,4_2,T,I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. I understand you had some symptoms recently they've been bothering you.,crq,,
1762,4_3,P,Yeah.,cd,,
1763,4_4,T,Could you tell me about those?,irq,,
1764,4_5,P,"Yeah, probably for the last eight months, maybe a year even, you know, I have this position at work where I have to make these weekly presentations and, and it's killing me. I can't do it anymore.",id,,
1765,4_6,T,Tell me about how these presentations are set up.,crq,,
1766,4_7,P,"So it's a it's, it's the executive director and it's 10 managers, we're kind of sitting in a circle and everybody goes around and does like a weekly program update. Five minutes or so maybe 10. At the most if there's an issue that kind of needs to be adjusted. And but everybody takes turns speaking and it goes around kind of around in a circle. And you know, depending on where you said is what order you present and basically",cd,,
1767,4_8,T,and you say that this situation the presentation you said it's killing you.,crq,,
1768,4_9,P,"Yeah, ",cd,,
1769,4_10,T,would feeling so you have,crq,,
1770,4_11,P,"I feel like it's constantly on my mind and constantly worried about this presentation. And even though I only have to speak for like five minutes, I'm so consumed by by this part of my job that I can't I can't do anything else and I normally feel like I do good in my job but but this and, you know, it just, it builds up more like every day the day before is is really bad because I'm prepping for the meeting. And so it really starts to consume me then I don't sleep the night before. And then by the time you know, I get to the meeting I'm, I'm so anxious and so nervous, I'm panicking and everything, and I just can't. I just can't.",cd,,
1771,4_12,T,"So, so this is this is distressing for you.",orq,,
1772,4_13,T,"And this is probably difficult to, to talk about the beginning of the meeting what would be your anxiety level what's going on then?",orq,,
1773,4_14,P,"By the beginning of the meeting, when I've sat down, I'm, I'm, I feel like I'm breathing harder. I'm starting to sweat. And I feel like my face is turning red. My palms are really sweaty and costly having to wipe them off on my pants. I My heart is racing. And I feel like you know, the closer it gets to being my turn, I feel like everything just gets worse. I feel like I'm breathing harder and my heart is beating faster and louder. I feel like everybody can hear it. My stomach just gets in knots, I feel nauseous. And I can't, you know, there have been times that I've managed to like just hold my hand still, and just sit really still. And I've tried some deep breathing and just satin and have made it through. And I have have made it to my, my presentation and and been able to speak but even then when I speak, I stutter and I stammer over my words, and I don't say everything I need to even I have a cheat sheet essentially. And I can reframe it. I still feel like I'm missing things and I'm leaving things out and my voice doesn't project so I end up speaking very softly and like I said, I'm stuttering, I just can't get it. Even then, it's it's still I feel like it's still a mess.",od,,
1774,4_15,T,"You're not you're not happy with the quality of your prison. Now even even when you're able to kind of stay there and conducted, so I want to divide this into the stages. So we talked about the very beginning. So you're already having anxieties sounds like it's fairly intense at that point. Tell me about as they go around the table and give their brief presentations. Tell me about what you're feeling as, as the presentations come around to you.",irq,,
1775,4_16,P,"Well, if I if I manage somehow to get there early enough, and I can get an early enough seat like to sit like right next to my boss, or like, like one or two away, then I'm actually pretty okay. Because I can, I can kind of get it over and done. But so many times I'm so nervous and honestly, a bit hungover because I've been drinking too to try and I don't feel anxious want to drink. So there have been a lot of times that I've I've woken up a little bit late because I've been drinking. And so by the time I get there, like one of the last, it's one of the last seats, so I'm one of the last to go. And so as it gets closer and closer to me, I just feel more and more anxious and panicky. And here in, especially in the last few weeks, I've had to leave, I can say, I've got to go.",id,,
1776,4_17,T,"So before before the presentations come around to you, you get up and yeah, leave the room. So in those times when you've stayed in the room and you've done the presentation, so the anxiety, the anxiety, the panic, the heart rate, sweaty palms, all these symptoms are increasing as they go around the table or the room and when it comes to you actually giving your presentation. You're not happy with that but what strings it level like during your presentation.",crq,,
1777,4_18,P,"I feel like during the presentation, I feel almost like everything. So everything stops. And then and then when it's done, and it goes to whoever's next. It's like, it's almost like a physical sense of relief. Like, okay, that's over and everything starts to relax and calm down, but then I feel miserable. I am so, so upset with how I performed that, that more than anybody else that that might that will really that everybody is like, What is wrong with her, but that my boss especially is like, why did I give her this job again, and I feel so so miserable, that that I've I feel like I've disappointed him and I've so I've disappointed me. And I mean, this has always, always happened to me. For as long as I can remember, I've never been able to speak in front of groups and you know, from back in college. If I had to make a presentation, I would ask the teacher if there's a way out of it. And if they refuse, then I wouldn't present. And I had a teacher who insisted that I make the presentation, and I dropped the class and I took it again, with a different teacher that wouldn't make me present because I couldn't do it. And High School is the same that I would, you know, I just wouldn't do it. And actually, this is ridiculous. You know, I mentioned drinking. I've been drinking for a really long time. When I was like, I don't know like, 13 or 14, I got busted for underage drinking and I had to do some, like adolescent treatment and I had to do this like group therapy with these other kids and I couldn't do that i bolted out of the room and so never been able to do this ever.",cd,,
1778,4_19,T,"See if you've had these symptoms for a long time, they've been frustrating you for a long time have a period of time where you haven't had to be in front of other people.",orq,,
1779,4_20,P,"Um, well if I haven't had to be in front of other people I've been I've been kind of okay you know, I can go to the movies but I like to sit on yet and you know, I can go out with with my family and my friends and we can go shopping but I don't like to go to new places. I like to go kind of like the same places that have familiar Yeah, yeah. Cuz because I know them. You know, I know The layout of stores and things like that.",od,,
1780,4_21,T,"So it interferes with your functioning. Maybe a little bit. But if you're not having to present, it's not as big a deal as it is now for you. Yes job. ",crq,,
1781,4_22,P,"Yes, ",cd,,
1782,4_23,T,"it's really affecting it. So are you taking any measures? Or have you take any measures other than drinking, you mentioned, to avoid a situation to avoid?",crq,,
1783,4_24,P,"Oh, definitely. I mean, there's like I said, I mean, I've run out of the meetings. There's been times that I've called in sick when I haven't been there's been times when I've, I've said I've had car trouble arrived so late that it was unreasonable to make my presentation. I've actually talked to my boss about possibly not doing the presentation and just giving my notes to him or to brief him before after and because I have to say that I have this problem. I mean, Normal people don't do this, right? I mean, normal people can make these presents, like the rest of the staff can do it, why can't I? And so I don't want to tell him that, you know, I that there's something wrong with me. I mean, it's, it's gotten to the point that I've talked to him about, you know, this other position that's in another department and transferring so that I wouldn't have to do this anymore. And and it would it would be a pay cut. I mean, it's a demotion but I can't live like this.",cd,,
1784,4_25,T," This is too painful. If you had the other job, his other job would involve presentations. So you'd be happier. You'd have fewer symptoms in that job. What's been the result of that discussion? Has there been anything has happened as far as well.",orq,,
1785,4_26,P,He has told me that he thinks something In a good job,od,,
1786,4_27,P,"excuse me, and he doesn't want me to. Here's what I'm going to change positions. But I can't, I can't do this anymore.",od,,
1787,4_28,T,"All right, so you've you've tried, you try to cope with anxiety. You've had to leave colon, colon sick or come in late. You've looked for different position or doesn't involve presenting. You've had this problem in other circumstances, the group therapy and in presentations before",gc,,
1788,4_29,T,Do you or have you seen any symptoms like this and your parents?,yq,,
1789,4_30,P,"Yeah, both of my parents and my sister actually. We were kind of joke about it. Some times that we all get so nervous. And my sister, I don't know how but she managed to find a job where she doesn't interact with anybody.",ack,,
1790,4_31,P,"It's her in her office with our computer by herself. And it's just, it's just hurt. I don't know how she pulled it off. I mean, she doesn't. She hardly talks on the phone.",gc,,
1791,4_32,P,"And she's really happy and my parents they actually they they met in college. When my dad after my mom made a presentation, my dad, I guess, leaned over and was like, you know, I could tell you're really nervous, but today great and they just they seem to bond over this nervousness that they both had.",gc,,
1792,4_33,T,"Right? So there may be maybe a history, a family history of symptoms. like these, this distressing for you, you tried to avoid it and deal with it but you haven't been you don't feel you've been very successful coping with it.",crq,,
1793,4_34,T,We'll get you in for treatment we'll catch in the next couple days to see a counselor. If that's what you'd like to do.,orq,,
1794,4_35,P,"Yes, please ",cd,,
1795,4_36,T,"think that could help. And I want to thank you for spending this time with me. It's really helped me to understand better what you're, you're facing. ",gt,,
1796,4_37,P,Thank you.,gt,,
1797,4_38,T,"Thanks, Sasha.",gt,,
1798,41_0,P,"In one day, and none of them worked and it was so it was so frustrating because I took so much time out of my work to go and I still couldn't find an appropriate placement for her",gc,,
1799,41_1,T,my advice would be for you or your daughter to at least and a week at the program.,gc,,
1800,41_2,P,Again she needs to get the feel no we can't do that I there there's no way I can take her I can't I couldn't drag her back there. Either any of those programs.,gc,,
1801,41_3,T,So what are you looking for?,irq,,
1802,41_4,P,I need your help to find a program that fits her,id,,
1803,41_5,T,"if I give you three more programs, Will that work? ",irq,,
1804,41_6,P,But But what if they don't work? How about if I,id,,
1805,41_7,T,need to give it a chance you need to go and visit again.,crq,,
1806,41_8,P,I know,cd,,
1807,41_9,T,"at least whenever out of your busy schedule,",gc,,
1808,41_10,P,"I actually came across a program, which is perfect for her. And I really would like for you to help me see if this could work. And I'd rather for you to try to do that instead of me shopping around for other programs because so far the ones that have been offered me have not worked.",od,,
1809,41_11,T,"So the program that you're interested, you want me to go with you or you want me to, I want you to want me to do",crq,,
1810,41_12,P,"I want you to see if, if, if I could choose that program instead of one or the others that you have offered.",cd,,
1811,41_13,T,"Okay, well looking at my schedule, it probably won't be until maybe two weeks my schedule is pretty much tied up.",id,,
1812,41_14,T,The case just got transferred to me so I'm not very familiar with your situation.,gc,,
1813,41_15,P,"Right? I will. My daughter is 17 years old, okay. She she's actually very high functioning thankfully. And, you know, I went to three of these programs. And none of them worked.",id,,
1814,41_16,T,"So you're looking, you're looking for a day program, right? And something that really was good for your daughter.",yq,,
1815,41_17,P,"Right. Right. And, I mean, I was looking for a program that would stimulate her, you know, that would that she really enjoy going to, but, I mean, they were either like babysitting programs or they were just participants were all at like, different developmental levels so that she couldn't really she could make friends.",ack,id,
1816,41_18,P,"Yeah, they were they were not not good for her.",id,,
1817,41_19,T,"You while you were there, it was difficult. Your daughter didn't really kind of fit in or connect with anybody while you were visiting.",crq,,
1818,41_20,P,"no, she did not she. She just there just wasn't that that sense of like, that common commonality, you know, just there was no, no basis for like friendships there were there were there were some young people there who are like screaming, yelling and who are talking to them. And she didn't know how to engage. ",cd,,
1819,41_21,T,And so so just there wasn't when when you visited they didn't sort of the program didn't help you to connect cert help your daughter to connect to anything that was going on that you were just sort of viewing it.,gc,,
1820,41_22,P,"Right it Well, I mean, I observed from a whole day each of these programs Okay, which was a lot of time Yeah, yeah. I mean, like I you know, I work full time and I don't, it was very difficult to schedule time to go to these places. And once I did, it was just so disappointing.",gc,,
1821,51_0,T,Hi You How you doing today.,gt,,

It's been great like I've I mean I used to have issues with mood but I don't anymore and now I just oh for at least you know, last couple days at least. Maybe about a week. I don't know I haven't been paying attention but I've thought awesome like I've gotten so much done. You know I do stuff at work. I do stuff at home. I went shopping. I am doing great with Like, well, kinda great with my interpersonal relationships like I was thinking about at work this week, I thought I was like so proud of myself I. Well, firstly, I got a promotion. And also, so I was happy with that. But then I know one of my co workers, he had his birthday. So I was like, Oh, let me do something nice for him. And I went home and I baked the cake, but it's kind of annoying, because when I got there, he got mad, which is stupid, because he said, he didn't appreciate the fact that he said over the hill, but he's like, old, so I thought it'd be funny, but it wasn't apparently. But so yeah, besides that, like, this week's been awesome. And, you know, like I said, I got my promotion and made a lot of money. Like with a nice increase, I should say. And I just, yeah, so I've been feeling awesome. Getting a lot done.",cd,id,
1827,51_6,T,Yeah. You feel like you're getting a lot accomplished at work at home and what types of things you,crq,,

And I at home I have been working on my, like unpacking because I moved in kind of a while ago, but I have still had boxes sitting around and stuff. So I got that all taken care of. I'm completely unpacked. Over the weekend, I went and bought some, like home decor stuff. So it really makes the house look just like I want it to look and I'm happy with it.",cd,id,
1829,51_8,T,So your mood is moods up. They your brother specifically had concerns about spending money.,crq,,
1830,51_9,P,"I mean, he's worried because I went on a shopping spree so he doesn't really know how much I am making with this new promotion and I don't really want to tell him I might I might actually because I'm proud of myself like I deserve it and I you know, we're still hard for so long in this company. And so with the shopping spree was kind of like treating myself. And so I've gone I went out and I did spend a lot of money. I actually maxed out one of my credit cards, but I don't have a lot of bills right now. Like I paid off all my debts, and I finished paying off my student loans too, so I could pay for it. So that's why he's worried. And like, I called him because I ran out of space in my car, and I was going to try to put this table that was gonna buy on top of my car bins and have like one of those things to attach it. So it didn't work out. And so I think you kind of got worried because he thought I was buying too much, but I returned that item because obviously I couldn't fit in my car and he couldn't come help me. So besides I've been fine.",cd,id,
1831,51_10,T,"So you haven't you haven't gotten any trouble at work, or at home or anything?",irq,,
1832,51_11,P,"No, not at all. I mean, like I said, I got approached at work. My bosses are extremely happy with how productive I've been how much I'm getting done. The quality of my work, I'm able to like, look over the reports and everything I turn in several times before I do it, and I always make sure I do. So.",id,,
1833,51_12,T,"Okay. Any changes with your sleep habits? Um,",irq,,
1834,51_13,P,"yes and no. I mean, yes, because I haven't really been sleeping as much as I used to. I think I used to sleep too much. But like, I haven't needed to this week, like, but it hasn't been an issue. It's actually been a good thing.",id,,

1848,51_27,P,"No, not really. I mean, no. I mean, obviously you hear about people dying on TV or like friends and family members, but like, I don't dwell on it. I feel like in the past I might have but I, I haven't been",cd,id,

1856,51_35,P,Is that ok here for him?,yq,,
1857,51_36,T,"your friend. Okay, so it'd be okay with you. I'd like you to speak with a counselor, at least for a little bit. I can arrange that in just a few moments if that's okay, ",ack,id,

1862,52_2,T,I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.,gt,,
1863,52_3,T,How has the anxiety been going?,irq,,
1864,52_4,P,"Um, since last session, it seems to be in check.",id,,
1865,52_5,P,Nothing really major. It's been going on with it. So I think,id,,
1866,52_6,P,I'm getting to a point where it's under control.,id,,
1867,52_7,T,"I subsided a bit. That's good. Yeah, that's good. How's things been going at work lately?",irq,,
1868,52_8,P,"So works a little bit of a different story. Um, we have our daily meetings, and I actually had to clean like one of my co workers aside because I feel like they undermine me all the time. And they like, they don't give me the respect basically, that I deserve. So I took her outside after the meeting and lean into her about it. And afterwards, I mean, the next day, because we have these things every day, and she like, she came back and came at me again. But it was worse, even after talking for",id,,
1869,52_9,P,no.,on,,
1870,52_10,T,"So you have these, someone understands you have these daily meetings? Right. And you mentioned that she's not showing you respect and that you deserve respect. Right? effect. So tell me, tell me about that. Believe from what we talked about ABC before activating events and beliefs and consequences. In our abt, tell me about that belief.",irq,,
1871,52_11,P,"Or I just feel that I do a good job and I deserve to be respected by my coworkers. Yeah, it just",id,,
1872,52_12,T,other levels of respect. There's a certain level of respect that you demand or need.,orq,,
1873,52_13,P,"I don't know if there's a certain level, but I feel just like, I deserve it. You know,",od,,
1874,52_14,T,and what did she do? That kind of convinced you that she wasn't meeting that level of respect?,irq,,
1875,52_15,P,"Well, she was like, she doubt my ideas, um, and just kind of made me feel like a fool, basically. So I just I didn't understand.",id,,
1876,52_16,P,right,gc,,
1877,52_17,P,"I mean, I guess.",gc,,
1878,52_18,T,Have you criticized other coworkers?,yq,,
1879,52_19,P,yeah.,ack,,
1880,52_20,T,So do you think that her criticism was within normal limits like within the what you've kind of seen there regularly,irq,,
1881,52_21,P,"I mean, now that you pointed out I mean, I guess I can view it in that way that it wasn't.",id,,
1882,52_22,P,it just felt like she was purposely trying to nitpick if you were,id,,
1883,52_23,P,Yeah.,ack,,
1884,52_24,P,"I mean, I guess I may have gone out or a little partially um, But I felt at the time that it was reasonable",id,,
1885,52_25,T,at the time when you were?,irq,,
1886,52_26,P,when I was talking to her outside of the meeting.,id,,
1887,52_27,T,"So you felt that she was a bit harsh. You talk to her about it, but then she's become more harsh. So where do you stand with her now? Like the meeting? Well,",irq,,
1888,52_28,P,"I've just been trying not to talk to her. And obviously, in a work situation, doesn't really help. ",id,,
1889,52_29,T,It's not convenient. Yeah. It might not help. Alright. So let's work this through using the ABC model that we use for the anxiety that you had before. Right? That was troublesome to you before. What would the activating event be here in this situation?,irq,,
1890,52_30,P,So I guess the confrontation I had whether,id,,
1891,52_31,T,Was this criticism?,yq,,
1892,52_32,P,Yeah. Yeah.,ack,,
1893,52_33,P,So She criticized me and I felt disrespected.,id,,
1894,52_34,T,That's a feeling,orq,,
1895,52_35,P,I feel or my my belief is that I deserve respect.,od,,
1896,52_36,P,being upset and like disrespected and again yeah ,od,,
1897,52_37,T,"was aggravation, yeah. frustration, frustration. So that's, that would be one of the consequences of how you processed her behavior. Does that make sense? Feeling the frustration Feeling would be one of the consequences like an ABC kind of chance you have the activating event. She criticizes you. Your belief is that you deserve respect. And clearly she violated that belief. Right? She She didn't show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system. And one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration. Were there any other consequences?",irq,,
1898,52_38,P,"Well, if we, like go forward, it's the kind of disarray or the tension, I guess, you know, in the office.",id,,
1899,52_39,T,"To get that's, that's definitely a consequence. I'm thinking there's an intermediate consequence stuff. So you had that feeling of frustration. And what's the next thing you did after that meeting was over, ",irq,,
1900,52_40,P,"like confronted her, ",id,,
1901,52_41,T,"you confronted her? Right. So you have kind of those two consequences. And that confrontation, it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event. You could also think of as a consequence, but like I said, this is a cyclical. So you see how the A and the B and the C, a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you.",irq,,
1902,52_42,T,Does that make some some sense?,yq,,
1903,52_43,P,"It does. Yeah. And I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it's cyclical, then you just, I can see I can visualize that going around my carousel.",ack,id,
1904,52_44,T,"Sure, exactly. So it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future. Right. So we can't go back and change that, but we can work on the future. So her criticism of you there's no direct way to change that. consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right? One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking.",irq,,
1905,52_45,T,"So, kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way. But, you know, I, I demand and deserve respect, right at this particular level and people aren't meeting it. Right. Would you say that's a fair?",id,,
1906,52_46,P,Yeah.,ack,,
1907,52_47,T,"Okay. Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you'd like respect? respects good. Yeah. respects healthy and work environments, certainly. But if you don't get it, you can still function. It's tough for you. I can see that's tough. Tell me about that.",irq,,
1908,52_48,P,"I mean, I understand But you're saying I get it? I guess it's just kind of like anxiety with the anxiety we worked on. It's just getting there. ",id,,
1909,52_49,T,Mm hmm. Do you are you willing to think of and challenge your beliefs in this instance?,ack,yq,
1910,52_50,P,Yes.,ack,,
1911,52_51,T,"Yeah. Tough though just as you mentioned, like what the inside says tough How long have you had this belief cuz mentality of I deserve respect.",irq,,
1912,52_52,P,"Oh gosh, Um, since I was like a teenager. So long time",id,,
1913,52_53,T,this has been a relatively persistent part of your life. Let's play system. So changing it's going to be work.,gc,,
1914,52_54,T,"So, if you can apply a different philosophy apply more flexible thinking? Next time you're in a meeting, she still criticized you in the meetings. ",gc,,
1915,52_55,P,Yeah.,ack,,
1916,52_56,T,"So if you filter that through belief system now your first urge might be think to be, I'm being disrespected again. I it probably comes on that way. You kind of feel it.",gc,,
1917,52_57,P,"Yeah, it, it starts in my stomach and then goes all the way up.",ack,,
1918,52_58,T,"So it'll be your first physiological reaction, right and emotional reaction. But if you can kind of pause that moment and apply more flexible thinking, like I talked about, right, which is, I'd like respect, right. But I can survive and function without it. At some level, I can accept that. I'm not going to get it all the time. Other other areas of life for you do get respect. ",yq,,
1919,52_59,P,"Yeah. For my friends and my family, I feel I feel like they give me. it's actually mutual respect. They give me respect I give them respect and",ack,,
1920,52_60,P,"Well, I think",od,,
1921,52_61,P,"over time, if I learned to do that I first starting like within side of me like I wouldn't get that initial Like,",od,,
1922,52_62,P,punched in the gut.,od,,
1923,52_63,P,And I wouldn't have the urge to lash out at her. Especially if it is trying to be constructive criticism resulting in a situation where there's that tension in our office.,od,,
1924,52_64,P,I'd be able to do that I,od,,
1925,52_65,P,think I'd be able to approach her and maybe ask her she'd want to get coffee or something and maybe sit down and kind of,od,,
1926,52_66,P,talking with her.,od,,
1927,52_67,P,"maybe I misunderstood her in the first meeting. And she really didn't mean to undermine me as I said,",od,,
1928,52_68,P,and then go from there.,od,,
1929,52_69,T,"So either way, gathering the information, meaning having a discussing discussion with her, it would be helpful because I mean, you may find that you really see things so like, and it was just a disagreement in terms of her criticism in the way you interpreted, or she may have been trying to be critical and you'll know that to be really Can't control someone else's behavior. But it will give you an idea of maybe what our intentions were and how you can go forward to repair that relationship so that it functions. ",orq,,
1930,52_70,P,"Yeah. I certainly don't want like, our upper management to, you know, get involved and there'll be a bigger issue.",ack,od,
1931,52_71,T,"You don't want them to have to come and sort that out. Right, you can sort out their own. And that would be a good application of coping skills and flexible thinking. So is that something you feel like you can try over the course of the next week?",yq,,
1932,52_72,P,I will definitely try.,ack,,
1933,52_73,T,"So really our plan move forward as a couple parts. So one would be smooth things over and sensitive, discussing this with her, letting her know you're aware what's going on and you want to try to resolve it and the second part would be Trying to move a little bit away from the rigid, you know, I deserve respect to, I would like respect but I'll function adequately without respect from everyone. I know that's tough. That's gonna be that's gonna be the challenge, right? But this will be this will give us good information and give you some practice. Does it all make sense to you?",irq,,
1934,52_74,P,"Yeah, it's pretty clear. You explained it really well. Thank you.",id,,
1935,52_75,T,"So, let's work on those two, those two elements. Right and next time you come in, we'll check in on those two and make any needed modifications to our strategy and we'll kind of move forward from there. ",gc,,
1936,52_76,P,"Okay, ",gt,,
1937,52_77,T,that sounds good.,gt,,
1938,52_78,P,Sounds great.,gt,,
1939,52_79,T,"Thanks, Lisa. ",gt,,
1940,52_80,P,Thanks.,gt,,
1941,59_0,T,"So Tommy I wanted to talk to because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures that are kind of concerning to me of you and some of your friends at a party and you know, you're such a good kid, like, I don't know what you're doing drinking. It's not good and it will ruin your life",irq,,
1942,59_1,P,I mean it was just the like a social gathering it wasn't like I was looking for it the drinks were there and I all my friends were doing it and it was just it's it's not something that I like do okay on occasion but whenever the opportunity presents itself it it's nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes,irq,,
1943,59_2,T,"I Tommy there's so many consequences with drinking you know you're not even 21 yet you could get arrested you could you know have a drunk driving accident you could you know, mess up your schoolwork you have such a bright future ahead of you. It just really really concerns me.",gc,,
1944,59_3,P,"I get what you're coming from but I I really did. I thought that I had it under control. And I didn't let myself get too far gone. I didn't want to be in how do I put this little Like, I want it to be in control. And I wanted to make sure that all my friends were Okay, so I didn't let myself drink too much.",gc,,
1945,59_4,T,"There's really no such thing as not drinking too much. I mean, anything that's drinking when you're under age is drinking too much. You know, like, think about it. Think about all the things that can happen to you.",gc,,
1946,59_5,P,"Yeah, I understand exactly what you're saying. And",ack,,
1947,59_6,T,how much are you drinking?,irq,,
1948,59_7,P,"I don't think I'm drinking that much. I mean, it's, it's mainly for social gatherings. Like it's nothing that I do, like by myself or whatever. It's just the",id,,
1949,59_8,T,"it's like, every weekend.",crq,,
1950,59_9,P,"every other weekend, I would say,",cd,,
1951,59_10,T,"Tommy, I'm just so concerned, you know, can't you think of anything better to do?",irq,,
1952,59_11,P,"I guess I can, I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I do get where you're coming from.",id,,
1953,59_12,T,"Yeah, are your friends the problem? Like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you're partying with?",irq,,
1954,59_13,P,"Yeah, I guess I haven't really put it on myself, I guess it's really been forced on their account. And I've just been following in their footsteps just to just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun. And I just want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the high school experience that I can.",ack,id,
1955,59_14,T,"Well, there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice, right? That's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what's best for you. And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here.",gc,orq,
1956,59_15,P,"Yeah, I, I do see that. Maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to to a certain degree and I It does make a lot of sense. And I, I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level of drinking. ",ack,od,
1957,59_16,T,I think you really need to quit.,orq,,
1958,59_17,P,"Yeah, I mean, alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me wherever I go and parties and stuff that I, I kind of feel like I should just get used to it or at least understand its its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely. I don't I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life.",ack,od,
1959,59_18,T,"Think you're wrong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, I wish you would quit. If all you're gonna do is cut down that's better than nothing. You know, I appreciate you talking to me about this, but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it. It's really important. Yeah,",irq,,
1960,59_19,P,"I, I just I don't see the problem in it right now. And maybe it's because I haven't really had that dramatic of an experience. But,",id,,
1961,59_20,T,"um, do you want to wait for that to happen? Do you want to wait for a dramatic experience?",irq,,
1962,59_21,P,"You're right. I don't want I don't want to be too far gone. Before it's too late. Like I, I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape. And I I guess I've never really had any, any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much, or affected anybody close to me that much. So I guess it's something that I feel like I'm in control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think.",id,,
1963,59_22,T,"All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get to trial here and stop drinking.",gc,,
1964,59_23,P,"Yeah, I think that that would be a good step forward into an A life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol.",gc,,
1965,59_24,T,Okay. Sounds good.,gt,,
1966,79_0,T,"Alright, so let's see if we could just talk about the moment of the presentation again. I want to try to help you develop some strategies to bring those anxiety symptoms down. ",id,,
1967,79_1,P,"Okay, right. ",ack,,
1968,79_2,T,"Let's actually go right before the moment so you're still in the, you're still sitting down, and you're getting ready to present. Let's just say your second present. Yeah, like we've talked about and you're thinking they're going to seeming as anxious. They're gonna think I don't belong here. These are the right. Okay. So these thoughts occur because you have an expectation rule one add to that you brought into that class, when you walked into that class, you have these expectations already. It's perfectly natural. It's not right or wrong. Everyone has these beliefs. And whenever these beliefs are and we'll talk about that another point, they combined with the stressor of having this presentation in front of you, right, and the classmates watching you, and they result in these thoughts. We call them automatic thoughts, ",id,,
1969,79_3,P,okay,ack,,
1970,79_4,T," And just like the beliefs, they're not good or bad. They don't say anything about the person having them. They're just thoughts. Actually, they're fairly understandable and natural thoughts. The problem is that they lead to symptoms. So, you're sitting there at your desk, and you're thinking, they're gonna see that I'm anxious. They're gonna realize I'm not good enough. I think I'm not good enough, right? What reaction Do you have when you have that far?",id,,
1971,79_5,P,"I guess I'm like very observant, like I started looking around, like, I'm sweating. Like I'm having physical responses, and I'm looking around to see if anyone's already looking at me, like hyper vigilance.",id,,
1972,79_6,T,so distressing symptoms.,id,,-1
1973,79_7,P,Yeah.,ack,,
1974,79_8,T,"What's something that you could send yourself in that moment, that would maybe get in between that thought, and that reaction, so that thought of, I'm not gonna know I'm not good enough. I think I'm not good enough. And that reaction",irq,,
1975,79_9,P,"I mean, I think in that moment, most people are looking at the person who's presenting and not at me. And so that, you know, I can maybe like, take some deep breaths or try to calm myself down. Maybe like look over my notes one more time. Because they're all watching the person who is presenting not me.",id,,
1976,79_10,T,"Okay. So some some deep breathing, looking over your notes, like preparing yourself for kind of focusing on that and realizing they're not really looking at you anyway for a moment. Okay, good. Good. Um, you bring your notes with you to class?",id,,
1977,79_11,P,"I mean, like usually have like index cards, or maybe like some stats on something that I want to look over like some numbers or something I don't want to forget.",id,,
1978,79_12,T,Okay. So You always have those with you.,yq,,
1979,79_13,P,Yeah.,op,,
1980,79_14,T,It's just a matter of can you focus your attention on them?,yq,,
1981,79_15,P,"Right, exactly enough to not forget them.",id,,
1982,79_16,T,"And you know, if you're focusing on that, and you're thinking about that, you're not thinking about whatever they might be thinking about",crq,,
1983,79_17,P,"Right, exactly.",cd,,
1984,79_18,T,And how about the deep breathing? Is that a strategy you've tried before?,irq,,
1985,79_19,P,"a little bit, but with not much success, because usually when I think to remember it, I'm in, you know, panic mode, and then it's really hard.",id,,
1986,79_20,T,So you've been able to do it sometimes.,crq,,
1987,79_21,P,"Yeah, not often, not consistently.",op,,
1988,82_0,T,"HI Sam, Thanks for waiting. I talked to your mom a little bit about some of the things that were going on at home in school. And now I'm going to spend a few minutes with you asking you some questions. The questions I ask all the kids, some of them are going to kind of fit for you and some of them might not fit so well. But if there's things that you're curious about, I'm asking or if you have questions as we're talking, then feel free to ask me about why I'm asking something or ask any questions. Okay. The first thing I wanted to check in about was how have things been going at home? ",gt,,
1989,82_1,P,"Oh, okay. I guess. ",id,,

1998,82_10,T,What are some of the things that you might think she might do a bit better?,irq,,
1999,82_11,P,"pretty much every day,",id,,

You know was big cheering and That kind of made me feel really, really bad again, my heart was racing, start sweating and just kind of reminded me of being there and start thinking about it again. So, things like that, you know, pump up music when it comes on the radio, same kind of music they played there. Kind of makes you feel the same way my heart starts to race.

2075,86_20,T,"Do you find yourself working to avoid like, music too similar?",irq,,
2076,86_21,P,Yeah. I've been trying to avoid the radio because you never know what's going to come on on the radio. So I've been avoiding listening to music in case something like that happens and putting crowds,op,,

It's just, it's not me.",op,,
2081,86_26,T,"How about your awareness level of what surrounds you? Do you find that your awareness level has increased that you're, you're more aware?",irq,,
2082,86_27,P,"kind of depends. Sometimes I kind of feel like I'm in a daze and don't really know what's going on around me. But um, I've been one of the students that I work with the the pop up out from behind the door, which he would do all the time. And you know, typically, I would laugh and think it was funny before but he did the other day and I just could not control myself afterwards. Like, I couldn't calm myself down. You know, I didn't think was funny at all. It really, really scared me. And that went on for about 1015 minutes and I just my heart was racing. I had to go take a walk and just really hard to relax and after that,",id,,
2083,86_28,T,so you feel like your reaction to that was stronger than it normally would have been?,yq,,

2099,9_6,T,That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that.,gt,,
2100,9_7,P,"No, no, no. So yeah, it's just, you know, they let me go. I have really nothing to go on. I don't know what to do. I've been at that. job so long. I really don't know how to do anything else. ",gc,,
2101,9_8,T,You should talk about the job. You're happy there.,irq,,
2102,9_9,P,"Yeah. I was, I thought, you know, I envision doing that job for a long time. So, you know,",id,,
2103,9_10,T,"and that's not gonna happen. No, no. How does this affect your financial outlook like your bills and such?",irq,,
2104,9_11,P,"Oh, it's awful. I mean, we definitely my husband and I, it's really spiraled out of control. My husband and I have kind of like, joint, we pay the bills together. And so this was half of our income, and that's gone. And because it was kind of more sudden, we didn't really have time to do anything else, you know, time to prepare.",id,,
2105,9_12,T,So it definitely caught you off guard. Do you have enough income with your husband's job to cover your basic bills?,irq,,
2106,9_13,P,"were a little bit. Yeah, so far. But if I don't find the job soon, then I don't know what's gonna happen. I don't know how bad it's gonna get",id,,
2107,9_14,T,to know about how long you have for you fail to meet any financial commitments.,irq,,
2108,9_15,P,"My husband usually deals with the bills, so I'm not quite sure. But probably in another month or so it's going to get really bad for about a month.",id,,
2109,9_16,T,What thoughts have you been having?,crq,,
2110,9_17,P,"All sorts. I mean, I, I've worried that, you know, like, my husband and I are arguing because we're under all this stress. I worry, we're gonna lose our house. You know, I'm worried I'm going to be homeless. You know, it's embarrassing. I don't have a job now. What if I don't find another job? You know, what are my kids gonna do? My kids are, you know, relying on us to meet their needs. Yeah, yeah. So I mean, we could be homeless. I might not ever get a job again, you know, I'm not getting any younger. So I just am afraid that I won't get another job.",cd,,
2111,9_18,T,"Now, you said you were laid off, right? ",yq,,
2112,9_19,P,Yeah.,ack,,
2113,9_20,T,For the position. Are you eligible for unemployment?,orq,,
2114,9_21,P,I'm not sure I'm still looking into that.,od,,
2115,9_22,T,"Because if you I mean, I'm not a labor law expert. But I think if you're, if you're laid off, there's probably decent probability you could get on employment. How much for educational?",crq,,
2116,9_23,P,I just have my bachelor's.,cd,,
2117,9_24,T,"Well, that's, that's more than most bachelor's degree. Yeah. You just haven't had to look for a job in a long time, right here. Because I'm guessing you thought you're gonna retire.",orq,,
2118,9_25,P,Yeah,od,,
2119,9_26,T,"So this is upsetting for a lot of reasons. So you have The financial stressors, right? I can't be minimized. The relational stressors mentioned, it's kind of embarrassing. Yeah, that's more like an identity thing I see identify with what you did right now. You don't as much, because you're not actively working in it. Yeah. Did you ever have any co workers who voluntarily left for other jobs?",crq,,
2120,9_27,P,Not that No.,cd,,
2121,9_28,T,Not at the time you worked there.,crq,,
2122,9_29,P,"Not that I was aware of that. I think maybe it maybe like one A while ago, but it was a pretty good job. So. ",cd,,
2123,9_30,T,So a lot of people stay.,crq,,
2124,9_31,P,Yeah.,cd,,
2125,9_32,T,Have you ever known anybody who worked for a similar company or in the same field? Who change jobs?,orq,,
2126,9_33,P,"Yeah, one of my friends was in a similar field and he left the job and eventually found another job. You know how long it took. It took a while. It took a while. Like, maybe like two years or so at least almost, yeah, it was a struggle for their family. So I think about that",od,,
2127,9_34,T,would you need to replace that full income to pay your bills or part of that income?,irq,,
2128,9_35,P,"I mean, probably part of it maybe full would be ideal because, you know, we were comfortable the way we were living so far would be ideal, but you know, we could probably survive on on part of it, it just not as well as we were living.",id,,
2129,9_36,T,"So we've talked about problem solving skills before in earlier sessions, right. So have you applied a those concepts to what's going on now.",crq,,
2130,9_37,P,"I mean, I've been trying to think of think of, you know, different opportunities that might be open to me now and you know, being able to spend more time with my kids and things like that. I've been trying to think of it other ways my situation.",cd,,
2131,9_38,T,"So there's sort of an upside, and then sense the time part, at some point need to replace the income. Yeah, that's very pragmatic in the money. Have you considered that if you attempted to seek a full time job to work out, you could look at part time jobs.",orq,,
2132,9_39,P,"I've thought about it, but I'm really having a hard time with it.",od,,
2133,9_40,T,"What would it What would it mean about you? What would it say about you if you had to take a part time job, so finding another full time job is so much of the loss?",orq,,
2134,9_41,P,"What would it mean about me is That I think if I only had a part time jobs that I wasn't qualified, that I wasn't good enough for full time.",od,,
2135,9_42,T,So you would you would internalize that and Meaning would be that you're not as valuable.,yq,,
2136,9_43,P,Yeah.,ack,,
2137,9_44,T,So it speaks to self worth.,crq,,
2138,9_45,P,"Well, right now it's not good. Well, I mean, I've been arguing with my husband, I've been drinking a lot more, you know, the depression has come back a lot worse. So it's just starting to become the cycle where you know, drinking and getting into arguments and situations not getting better and it just keeps snowballing keeps snowballing.",cd,,
2139,9_46,T,"Yeah. And these these behaviors are all things that potentially could impede your goal. So it is kind of like a self fulfilling prophecy element to this. Yeah. Do you agonize you worry, invest in these thoughts? Right? And then to temporarily take away the pain you drink? Yeah. That ends up being more dysfunction, right with a relationship with your husband. Yeah. Imagine if you're intoxicated, you're not looking for new work. Yeah. That wouldn't be ideal timing. So, in a sense, you're, you're not helping things to improve. And it all kind of starts without thinking, ",crq,,
2140,9_47,P,"but it's hard when I'm really depressed and the situation's not getting better. And I'm just home sitting about, you know, drinking, while everyone else is carrying on with their life, and I'm stuck here.",cd,,
2141,9_48,T,"And that ties into that kind of worthless, type five. So you're fulfilling that role. worthless. That sounds manifesting for you. And that's one thing you can do. That's an option you can drink and you could have relational struggles. But is that really? Is that really what you want at all? Is that the most useful? ",crq,,
2142,9_49,P,"Really? No, it's not helping. ",cd,,
2143,9_50,T,How do you think you could break that cycle?,irq,,
2144,9_51,P,"I've been thinking about, you know, trying to get more organized, like we talked about before with the finances and, and trying to, you know, figure out exactly how much income we need to be where we want, what to do and maybe by baby steps, so it's not like, so overwhelming for me like the thought of getting a new job and making enough money and providing for my family. And like breaking it down.",id,,
2145,9_52,T,"Well, that makes sense. Yeah, so the first step would be figuring out what The minimum amount you really need, right? So you'll shoot for hire full time, but you realize that you kind of need to know what the minimum is because you know what job offer you could accept in which I want free time to decline. Right? So it makes sense. So armed with that information and you could go into the workplace, right? And it was less anxiety kind of just know this Job's gonna if I get it, that's good, right Lord, I might as well not apply to this one because it's not gonna work. So as efficient as time say, it's good. That sounds logical.",crq,,
2146,9_53,P,"I think just sometimes like the fear of the unknown, like, worry about what if this never happens for me? You know, what if I don't get a job? You know, what if we lose our house?",cd,,
2147,9_54,T,"That worries Yeah, no worries. nagging Yeah. Yeah. So",gc,,
2148,9_55,P,"I mean, worst case, if we don't get a job, I mean, probably. I don't know, like, get a smaller house, or find a way around it. I mean, she would need to have some tough times. ",gc,,
2149,9_56,T,"Yeah. It would be difficult, right? To be fair, right? It would be difficult, but you would adapt.",crq,,
2150,9_57,P,"Right? So like, it would be difficult but I think if I really thought about it, you know, we would probably get through it.",cd,,
2151,9_58,T,"So if we pick up with that we say that's really an adaptive response when we talk about adaptive responses to automatic thoughts, right? So if you're telling yourself that you have the depression and certainly anxiety, craving to drink, you tell yourself well, the worst that could happen is I don't work the rest of my life again, acknowledging that's pretty unlikely. But the worst thing to happen is I won't work again. And I might have to adapt, I might have to have a simpler life in terms of material goods and small house, but I would survive would affect my battery that have on on your mood, or your thoughts?",orq,,
2152,9_59,P,"I mean, I think when I really think about it, you know, like you said, I think I'm less depressed or think that I, you know, I'm more able to cope with it. You know, knowing Okay, well, this is the worst that could happen, but maybe it's not as bad as I thought. would be embed. ",od,,
2153,9_60,T,"So there's a piece that comes with clarity that comes with accepting what the worst case scenario could be. Right? And probably another part of the adaptive response could be, you know, I could live to the worst case scenario. I think it's important to acknowledge that it's unlikely. that's unlikely. Right? So statistics probability is on your side here. Right? So, as you go out to the workplace and the workforce and seek employment, you'll probably have some, some interviews, we don't get a job offers, right. But eventually, if I have one where you do, yeah, right. It's, it's just math. Right? If you can accept the worst case that maybe reduce or limit that alcohol consumption, reduce that depression, anxiety.",crq,,
2154,9_61,P,Yeah.,cd,,
2155,9_62,T,"So Let's end there for today. But I want you to try for the next week. I want to try plan that adaptive response, right? Actually, there's two we're talking about right? One is you could survive the worst case scenario. And the other one is that probabilistically It won't happen. Right? So you have kind of two. Well, you do have two adaptive responses I want you to apply when those automatic thoughts come up, like, I'm never gonna work again. Okay, this is a catastrophe. So like that self talk. Yeah, apply that self talk. So identify that automatic thought, because we've talked about that skill, right? And then apply that self talk right away. All right, and let's see, you have the thought record. Right. So when that you know, when you can fill one of those out, okay, when that happens when you have that automatic thought and you apply the adaptive response, even if you can't get it completely filled out, I understand that. I know there's a lot on there. Just what you can get done on that. Anything you can do. That would be helpful. ",crq,,
2156,9_63,P,Okay.,cd,,
2157,9_64,T,Sound good?,gt,,
2158,9_65,P,Yeah,gt,,
2159,9_66,T,So scheduled for one week. So I'll see you then we'll see how this goes to progress we can make on this on the alcohol and the depression and anxiety.,crq,,

2167,92_6,T,What happened?,irq,,0
2168,92_7,P,"yeah, so about two weeks ago, I was finishing up this wonderful machine that I was creating in my room, so that the government can't hear my thoughts or my, my actions or my behaviors. And I was just trying to finish up my last little bit that I needed to build and I went over to the neighbor, because their garage was open and just picked out a tool and brought it back to the house. And when I was in the house working on my my room, the cops came and picked me up and took me to the hospital. So it's like, see the government data to get",id,,-2
2169,92_8,T,what you think the government is trying to do.,irq,,0
2170,92_9,P,"They're trying to stop me from actually creating my room. Because they're, they're creating this new order where they want everybody to follow them. And I'm not a follower. And I know what I want. And I know what I need. And I know what my family wants, and I know what they need. And I'm just trying to protect them by creating my room.",id,,-1
2171,92_10,T,And tell me about your room. What what are you doing there that makes that special.,crq,,0
2172,92_11,P,So I was smart enough to know that there are frequencies and waves that are out there that the government is actually sending you through the lights and also through the TV and like through every electronic apparatus that is out there. And I'm actually creating doll or a wave neutralizer so that it can actually stop that from happening. So that you can actually live the life that you want and be happy and youthful and joyful all the time.,id,,0
2173,92_12,T,Is that how you were feeling when you were building?,yq,,0
2174,92_13,P,"Yeah, because I created this prototype in my room. And anytime I'm basically in there I was, it was good. I had energy. I didn't have everything that I wanted. But my prototype was running out of fuel. And so I needed to make it bigger, larger, so it can run longer.",op,,0
2175,92_14,T,That's what you're trying to do,crq,,0
2176,92_15,P,"Yeah, that's what I was trying to do when I wouldn't borrowed the tools from my neighbor but yeah, and then also I was ordering some things that were online. And they were also supposed to become be shipped in so that the base piece that I was creating, that I use the tools for my neighbor's house. It could have been all perfect and set so that when All of the hard drives in the electrical wiring and all of that stuff came in, I could just plug it in. And then not only my room covered, but also my houses covered and all of my family, they could just be happy.",cd,,1
2177,92_16,T,"They could be happy, they could be happy, like, you know, you were happy.",crq,,0
2178,92_17,P,"I was happy, like, so two weeks ago, I was I was good. I, I was up, I did all the calculations that I need to create. So I can actually build my base in my system. But then I also did the calculations about the different types of waves being in the house, but then also out of the house, that I also had the opportunity to just not sleep because I need sleep. I wasn't tired. And if I did sleep, I slept for like 15 minutes, just because I needed to finish what I was going to do. And I was so close to finishing and my neighbour called cops.",cd,,1
2179,92_18,T,So you had a period of time when you had like a lot of energy and you weren't really sleeping much,crq,,0

2189,92_28,T,Yeah. You mentioned you ordered some products online. How much did you order?,irq,,0
2190,92_29,P,"um, I think I ordered probably know the exact number I ordered 236 hard drives, because 236 is the perfect number that I needed to not only cover my bedroom, so I can always be happy and if the system went down, my room was always going to be covered. But then within that 236 it also covered my house so that my family could be happy, and like my four neighbors around us so we can all be happy. And that's the reason why I'm kind of angry at my one neighbor because I was including his house in all By my grid so that he can also be happy all the time.",id,,0
2191,92_30,T,He would have been affected by a machine.,crq,,0
2192,92_31,P,"Of course, he's the helping hand. He helped me out. He let me borrow his tools. but evidently he didn't let me borrow him this time. So just pull him out. Have another neighbor take his place.",cd,,0
2193,92_32,T,Were all those hard drives fairly expensive?,yq,,0
2194,92_33,P,"I don't know. When I was up cleaning and running around the house trying to find more equipment. I found my mom's purse and I was just like, oh my god, she has a credit card in there. Oh my god, I can use our credit card. So I was using our credit card because it's trying to make her happy. And so I don't know I added the 236. They were probably 50 to $100 apiece, depending on where it could get them and I just ordered them.",id,,0
2195,92_34,T,How'd your mother respond to that?,irq,,0
2196,92_35,P,"My mom came to the hospital and was like, where are all these boxes coming from? It's like this, but I'm in my room. And she put them into my room. And then, like a week ago, she has, like, I see my credit card, and she wants to happen.",id,,0

2199,92_38,T,"you get along, okay. ",crq,,0
2200,92_39,P,"we get along perfectly fine. Like that's, that's how we talk to each other. Like, we talk to each other minimally, because she's not in my room, so she's not happy. So anytime she does come into my room, it messes up the balance. So I get unhappy, and then I just tell her to stay out so that I can be happy and she can be happy in her own place.",cd,,-1

Apparently a very vulgar, profane, profane the words and So that's a little alarming to him. And I've even, you know, we've been hitting him in the middle of the night. You know, he's waking up with these huge bruises on his arms. And so yeah, apparently, a behavior in the middle of the night is out of hand.",id,,
2219,97_4,T,So I can understand why that would be distressing. Have you seen a physician about this?,yq,,
2220,97_5,P,"Yes. Um, I participated in a sleep study and what they say they rolled out some some other things and thought that maybe it was a behavior, Sleep Disorder. So they have referred me to you, I'm still working with them. Now. They're still running some tests and everything but they thought maybe there are some other stressors or underlying things, so",id,,
