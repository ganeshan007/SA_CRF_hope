163_2,T,stressed?,irq,,0.0,1
163_3,P,"Yeah, I feel like I have a lot on my plate. I have this test that I have to take for work.",id,,-1.0,0
163_4,T,What kind of test?,irq,,0.0,1
163_5,P,It's like an aptitude test. It has like math problems on it and like scenarios in order for me to move up to the system manager position.,id,,-1.0,0
163_6,T,"Now, that's a job that you've been interested in for a while.",irq,,0.0,1
163_7,P,"Yes. Yes. So I've been just feeling a lot of anxiety about taking the test and then they actually scheduled for me to take the test. And I want and I just got really overwhelmed. And I started like I felt my heart was racing. I felt like I wish my hands were shaking. And I just really couldn't concentrate on the test. Even though the night before me and my friend that practice problems, and I knew all the answers with no proper like, I didn't miss any of the questions",id,,-1.0,0
163_8,T,so you know the material on this test pretty well?,ynq,,0.0,4
163_9,P,yes.,yna,,0.0,5
163_10,T,"But the feelings and that the physiological response to heart rate and sweating, that feelings of anxiety plus those physiological responses they got in the way of you completing it, like you were unable to complete it.",gc,,0.0,3
163_11,P,"No, I wasn't able to complete it. And thankfully, they gave me a chance to come back. I just told him I didn't feel well. So they rescheduled so now I'm feeling a lot of anxiety because I'm scared the same thing is gonna happe, when I go back.",gc, id,-1.0,3
163_12,T,So you weren't you weren't feeling great about taking the test in the first place?,irq,,0.0,1
163_13,P,"Today, the night before, I felt like I know all the answers, but the minute I walked into the room, all of a sudden, all these fears kind of took over. ",id,,-1.0,0
163_14,T,But did you know that was coming?,ynq,,0.0,4
163_15,P,"Yes, ",yna,,0.0,5
163_16,T,you did ?Okay.,irq,,0.0,1
163_17,P,Yes.,id,,0.0,0
163_18,T,So you had some anxiety in advance?,irq,,0.0,1
163_19,P,"Yes, ",id,,0.0,0
163_20,T,"or no, you did. Okay.",gc,,0.0,3
163_21,P,"I had some anxiety the day before. But when I reviewed it with my friend, I'm like, Oh, I know the answers. I thought that would kind of push it down. But I think once I got there, it all came back up to the surface,",id,,-1.0,0
163_22,T,"erupt in that moment, and that prevented you. What do you think is leading to this?",gc, orq,0.0,3
163_23,P,"Well, I've always kind of struggled with tests. I'm like, I can remember when I was in third grade, I had to take this test, because I was really struggling in math. And I had to pass this test in order to move to the next grade. And I thought just like this test that I was ready for it, I had a tutor, and I felt really prepared for it. And then when I took it, I failed. And I was held back. And I feel like, you know, that was so it was, it was really embarrassing for me to be held back. And I felt like I don't want to say but I did feel like a failure at the time. Because I felt like I really didn't know this. I don't know why I couldn't pass the test.",id,,-1.0,0
163_24,T,And since that this was third grade.,gc,,0.0,3
163_25,P,Yeah.,ack,,0.0,6
163_26,T,And since that bad testing experience. Have you had trouble with tests since?,ynq,,0.0,4
163_27,P,"Yes, I always feel really anxious. I mean, I'm able to pass tests obviously because I graduated from college. School went on to high school. But it's so hard for me because of this anxiety that I feel that even though I may think I know it, I may still fail the test anyway, maybe like a repeat of what happened.",yna,,-1.0,5
163_28,T,"Alright, so in third and third grade, you had a really bad testing experience. And as you move forward from there, you've never really been thrilled about taking tests ",irq,,0.0,1
163_29,P,no,id,,0.0,0
163_30,T,"But you've been able to adapt. You've been able to take them and still, like pass them.",ynq,,0.0,4
163_31,P,"Yeah, I mean, sometimes I get an A. ",yna,,0.0,5
163_32,T,"So that's, that's good, right? ",irq,,0.0,1
163_33,P,"Yeah. I mean, yeah, it is good. Yeah, it's good.",id,,0.0,0
163_34,T,"But this particular test, which is not for scorches for work, yeah, this one, this is more of a stumbling block for you.",gc,,0.0,3
163_35,P,Yes.,ack,,0.0,6
163_36,T,You have any ideas as to what may what may be what may be making this test such a point of anxiety for you?,gc,,0.0,3
163_37,P,"I think it's just the fact that it's this promotion. So it's like the same thing. Like, if I fail, I'm being held back. And I feel like it's, we live in that moment of being held back. And that, that that's like a fear that I have that, um, that by not being able to pass these tests are holding me back.",gc, id,-1.0,3
163_38,T,So it really that same feeling you've had in third grade. That's coming up with this test.,irq,,0.0,1
163_39,P,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't put them together until now. But yeah.",id,,-1.0,0
163_40,T,"And the other test you take in throughout the rest of grade school in high school they didn't, they didn't have that same value attached to them.",gc,,0.0,3
163_41,P,"Now because they didn't have all that pressure that it was either win win or lose, basically, ",gc,,-1.0,3
163_42,T,"you could, you could take them again or take the course again or?",irq,,0.0,1
163_43,P,or I could take another test to raise the grade if I didn't do good on that.,id,,-1.0,0
163_44,T,so you have you maybe had more options in school?,ynq,,0.0,4
163_45,P,"Yes. Was it fail, you know, pass or fail?",yna,,-1.0,5
163_46,T,"Right, So it's the, it's the pressure is the pressure of you need to get through this. And you don't have the safety nets that you had in school? ",gc, yq,0.0,3
163_47,P,"Yeah, if I fail it, then I'm not going to be able to get the promotion, I would have to wait. Just like I did not have to wait a certain amount of time. I think an ear before I could take it again.",yna, id,-1.0,5
163_48,T,So this a lot of pressure.,irq,,0.0,1
163_49,P,Yeah it is,id,,0.0,0
163_50,T,So is there any time limit to this test for work?,irq,,0.0,1
163_51,P,"Um, no, there isn't.",id,,-1.0,0
163_52,T,There's no time.,irq,,0.0,1
163_53,P,No,id,,0.0,0
163_54,T,"How many Is it like a, like a multiple choice? ",irq,,0.0,1
163_55,P,"Yes, it is. ",id,,0.0,0
163_56,T,"Okay. And you seem like, like you said, you said the night before with your friend. ",gc,,0.0,3
163_57,P,Yeah.,ack,,0.0,6
163_58,T,You're really well prepared for it.,gc,,0.0,3
163_59,P,Yes.,gc,,0.0,3
163_60,T,"So I have a few a few thoughts about this. One is I'm wondering you know, we've talked before about cognitive therapy core beliefs. So I'm curious as to what you think about what core beliefs may be operating. For you now with this with this test, this work test",gc,,0.0,3
163_61,P,"that  I could fail that if I fail I could end up being a failure at all, you know, the things that I try",gc,,-1.0,3
163_62,T,"something like, I am a failure or I'm bound to be a failure, I'm destined to be a failure. ",irq,,0.0,1
163_63,P,I would say like I'm destined to be.,id,,0.0,0
163_64,T,"Okay, so  destined to be failure. So that, so that, potentially, is a core belief. Right? That's, that's operating.",gc,,0.0,3
163_65,P,"I mean, that's what scares me. That's, that's exactly the thought that I'm thinking when I'm about to take the test. And if I don't pass that, it's just gonna have like this domino effect of failure.",gc,,-1.0,3
163_66,T,"Okay, so it could be a core belief, but it's also seems like you're still on that thought. Like as you get ready to take that test. You're thinking I'm just destined to be a failure. ",gc,,0.0,3
163_67,P,Yeah.,ack,,-1.0,6
163_68,T,And you're having what sounds like a panic response to heart racing.,irq,,0.0,1
163_69,P,"Yeah, my hands shaking. ",id,,-1.0,0
163_70,T,Are you in the room alone? You're taking the test?,ynq,,0.0,4
163_71,P,"Yes, ",yna,,0.0,5
163_72,T,you are. So no one's really seeing you have this. I wouldn't want to call it a panic attack yet we haven't really gotten too far into it. But it sounds like it has some panic like features.,gc,,0.0,3
163_73,P,Yeah.,gc,,0.0,3
163_74,T,"Because it's not. It's interfering with you thinking clearly enough to get to the items. So, okay. So one thought I have is you have you ever had panic attacks in the past or anything like this?, the third grade thing?",gc, irq,0.0,3
163_75,P,"No, not really. I mean, sometimes I get worked out when I'm about to take a test, okay, but it's only around test.",id,,-1.0,0
163_76,T,And what happens once you get worked up like once your heart rate increases and You have any other physiological symptoms would,irq,,0.0,1
163_77,P,want to actually do take the test?,irq,,0.0,1
163_78,T,hmmm,id,,0.0,0
163_79,P,"Um, I kind of try to work through it and start trying to answer one question at a time to get to the last question.",id,,-1.0,0
163_80,T,"So one one possible strategy here is we talked about the adaptive response. Right? So, which is that thought that you say to yourself that self talk, I wonder if your doctor response couldn't be I can ride this out like you have no time to test? ",gc, crq,0.0,3
163_81,P,"Yeah, that's true. ",id,,0.0,0
163_82,T,"I mean, the panic responses only maintained for so long",gc,,0.0,3
163_83,P,and I could also choose like maybe questions that are no the answer to automatically so that could help maybe release some of that stress,gc,,-1.0,3
163_84,T,"to get some in a sense to get some minor victories under your belt by like, answering those right you know, you're closer to achieving your goal",gc,,0.0,3
163_85,P,"yes and then I feel like I know, at least I know that like, Don't validate the feeling that I maybe I can pass this test.",gc,,-1.0,3
163_86,T,"So the more items you you answer correctly, the less anxious you're gonna feel because you're closer to the end of.",irq,,0.0,1
163_87,P,"Yeah, definitely. Because then I start to feel more calm because I know that I know these questions are definitely going to be right.",id,,-1.0,0
163_88,T,"So that's so that's one well, that's a cognitive and behavioral strategy, right? Like you can you can wait out the panic. I mean, you're in the room alone.",gc,,0.0,3
163_89,P,"Yeah, that's true. Nobody's there. Nobody's gonna see me. I'm kind of trying to get myself together. ",gc,,-1.0,3
163_90,T,"Yeah. Now the panic painful. Right, the you know, the panic symptoms are painful. So what you could tell yourself is, this isn't pleasant. But I can write out these symptoms because they only last so long. ",irq,,0.0,1
163_91,P,"Probabiy, I could use like self talk. ",id,,-1.0,0
163_92,T,"Exactly. Yeah, because usually mean peg symptoms can run you know, five minutes. 10 minutes, 15 minutes. But you have no time limit? ",gc, crq,0.0,3
163_93,P,"Yeah,",id,,0.0,0
163_94,T,"yeah so if you can just kind of use that time to focus on the items, as you mentioned, you could get right. And kind of, at the same time be telling yourself I can ride this out.",gc,,0.0,3
163_95,P,"Yeah, I mean, I've done that in the past, so I can apply it to this test. ",id,,0.0,0
163_96,T,So if that's worked for you that ?,irq,,0.0,1
163_97,P,"yes, that has worked and I passed. ",id,,1.0,0
163_98,T,"So that's, that's certainly that's certainly one adaptive response to try writing. Another one could be that, although it wouldn't be great to fail, you can retake the test in a year. Right. You could try it. ",gc,,0.0,3
163_99,P,"Yeah, that's true.",gc,,0.0,3
163_100,T,"I mean, I know that's not what you want, but, but the alternative is kind of buying into that automatic thought we know that's not working. Right. The I'm I'm Destin, that was the word right like I'm destined to be a failure. We know that's not working for you. ",gc,,0.0,3
163_101,P,"So even if I have to take the test again and in a year, then I'm not going to be a failure because I still have the chance to take it again. It's not like I'll never be able to take this test again.",gc,,-1.0,3
163_102,T,"Yeah, you just have, you just have another years of study, right? And, of course, you wouldn't have that promotion that time and that would be an outcome, I know you don't want. But it's not the end of your career, It's not like something so drastic it's important to you and I can appreciate that. But it's not the end of your career. You're not going to be unemployed.",gc,,0.0,3
163_103,P,"No, no, definitely not. And just thinking back and relating it back to the third grade, even though I had to stay back. I still managed to, you know, do well the next year and keep moving up. And it hasn't really, in the long run prevented me from doing anything that I've wanted to do.",gc,,-1.0,3
163_104,T,"So that's great. That's another adaptive response, which you've survived this before.",gc,,0.0,3
163_105,P,"Yes, I definitely have.",gc,,0.0,3
163_106,T,"So this one event, I mean, I had the the incident third grade with the unpleasant experience but this one event you don't want that this kind of fashion. While use your word, your destiny by like this was one that seemed to catch you off guard but the the panic like symptoms. And fortunately your employer is going to give you the chance to retake and try this again. And, and I met you know, so you have I imagine you could you can write out these, these symptoms. And I think you have the other adaptive response, which is I've been successful this before.",gc,,0.0,3
163_107,P,"Yeah. I mean, definitely I feel a lot better now because I just know that no matter what happens, I've been here before, and I can get through it as opposed to like that feeling that I'm going to just fail together.",gc,,-1.0,3
163_108,T,"Oh, it's so good, when you have to take the test?",irq,,0.0,1

163_112,T,"And we'll, we'll make sure that you have these adaptive responses down and you're ready to go. Okay. And really will kind of focus on the positive outcome. Right. Okay, which is just taking this test taking one item at a time and fighting through some of these physical symptoms you're having, and fighting through the useful thoughts.",gc, id,0.0,3
163_113,P,"Okay. Yeah, I mean, that sounds good. That helped me prepare for the test. ",gc,,1.0,3

175_12,T,But first I want to get through kind of a piece on confidentiality.,id,,0.0,0
175_13,P,Okay. So like attorneys what you what you can do and not do.,irq,,0.0,1
175_14,T,"We kind of I'm glad you brought that up, about attorneys. Attorneys and clients have confidentiality, and counselors and clients have confidentiality, but the two types are different. So I'll explain to you how it worked between you and I. But no, that is a little bit different than it works between the attorney and their client.",id,,0.0,0
175_15,P,Okay. Now explain the differences to me.,cmd,,0.0,7
175_16,T,"Absolutely. So, one thing about a casting lationship all this time you spend here, the notes they'll take in during the assessment and the progress notes later on. Because all of a chart with your name on it will be stored in a secure place. All that is confidential, and next to that word confidential as an astress. Right? There's exceptions. Okay. And what I want to explain to you are those exceptions to confidentiality, because confidentiality isn't absolute.",irq,,0.0,1
175_17,P,"So there's times you might tell someone else something that I said,",id,,0.0,0
175_18,T,Yes.,ack,,0.0,6
175_19,P,Okay.,gc,,0.0,3
175_20,T,"Yeah. But they're very specific situations that occur that permit that or mandate that. Okay, I want to review those with you before we move on. Okay. Does that make sense?",gc, yq,0.0,3
175_21,P,Yeah. I'd like to know that before I tell you.,yna,,0.0,5
175_22,T,"I agree. That's a good, good way to look at it. So the first exception to confidentiality is when you give me permission to release information that you've disclosed and interactions we've had during counseling This is actually fairly common. For example, do you have a primary care physician? ",gc, yq,0.0,3
175_23,P,I do? Yes.,yna,,0.0,5
175_24,T,"So depending on we talk about you may want him or her to know about discussions. So you may sign a release, that gives that physician the right to talk to me directly. ",gc,,0.0,3
175_25,P,"That makes sense, ",gc,,0.0,3
175_26,T,"right. Furthermore, your issues with are part of your concern with your son. So say and I don't necessarily foresee this but say, later on, as we work together, you want him to come in for a session just to talk about something right? You would have to sign release confidentiality, so we could be here and talk with me. ",gc,,0.0,3
175_27,P,Okay.,gc,,0.0,3
175_28,T,That makes sense?,ynq,,0.0,4
175_29,P,That makes a lot of sense.,yna,,0.0,5
175_30,T,"Okay. The other exceptions are insurance company. So when you fill out your screen packet insurance Insurance companies have access to like progress knows the assessment, anything on the chart and they're generally responsible this information I don't know of any instances where they're irresponsible with it. But I just think it's important that you know that anything I write in the chart anything in the chart itself technically the insurance company can ask for and periodically could review. Again, I've never seen in my career any difficulty with that, but as far as I know that information would be transmitted off site so to speak. And when this agency bills it would be transmitted your information be transmitted off site to the insurance company",gc, id,0.0,3
175_31,P,so it goes automatically whatever progress made you have automatically go to the insurance company?,irq,,0.0,1
175_32,T,"the progress notes, don't for standard billing, but information about the type of session we had length of the session. any of that and some other personal information about you to identify you would go to them also they know a service was provided. ",id,,0.0,0
175_33,P,Okay.,ack,,0.0,6
175_34,T,"Like I said, There They're generally very responsible information, large companies that have done this for a while, right,",gc,,0.0,3
175_35,P,"taking all your medical stuff too. So they have,",gc,,0.0,3
175_36,T,"they have access to different types of data. Another exception to confidentiality and again, I don't foresee necessarily a this happening, but I want to tell you about the limits of it is in the event that I feel that you're going to harm, or there's a high potential that you're gonna harm yourself or someone else. In that instance, I'm obligated to act. Now, we're gonna probably talk about a lot of different elements of your life through the next however many weeks were together. Okay? When, and if, and again, I don't predict this. You have some sort of suicidal ideation or you want to harm smell. So in the unlikely event that happens, I would only release information I have to release to protect you or the person that I'm worried about. So if you review a lie like deep, dark secrets, and then you tell me that you want to go harm a relative of yours, right? I have a duty to warn that relative of what you plan on doing, where you are at the moment, what threats you've made, but I'm certainly not going to tell them about your deepest, darkest secrets to be revealed. Okay, unless they're directly relevant to protecting. Okay, it's very unlikely they would be,",gc, id,0.0,3
175_37,P,"I don't know why I not hurt anybody, but I should know this",gc,,-1.0,3
175_38,T,"I know. Yeah, but I just want to let you know that these know this confidentiality information I release is limited to just what I need to release. ",gc,,0.0,3
175_39,P,Okay,ack,,0.0,6
175_40,T,"Similarly, if you have any type of suicide ideation, and I was had to contact somebody come pick you up like law enforcement. I would only tell them I knew tell them from the get to the hospital and get you in a safe environment. ",id,,0.0,0
175_41,P,Okay,ack,,0.0,6
175_42,T,"This I want to take an opportunity Talking about the suicide ideation. So you know that just because you have suicidal ideation, like thoughts, a lot of people think about suicide from time to time, or even homicidal ideation or thoughts, you're going to harm someone by not saying kill, but it's harm does not by any means automatically me, I'm gonna call police think of it as something that opens a discussion certainly about your safety and someone else's safety. But that's not, you know, we don't go automatically from there. You know, that is, if you have a thought of suicide to the hospital. There's a discussion and many, most the vast majority, actually of people that have a suicide ideation do not have any intent or plan to commit suicide. ",gc, id,0.0,3
175_43,P,"So you say, so, if someone's thinking about it, you are not just gonna call the police and send you to the hospital. You're gonna try to get to the bottom of it.",irq,,0.0,1
175_44,T,Absolutely.,id,,0.0,0
175_45,P,Okay.,ack,,0.0,6
175_46,T,"Yeah. That, you know, I responsibility to make sure you're safe and I feel like I can do that. If we talk to Through an issue and you don't have any, any reason to believe you're going to harm yourself, but just had a suicidal thought, okay, okay, that's a lot different than you, you came in to me and told me about detail plan, and you really seem like you're going to do it, then I'd be a lot more worried. ",id,,0.0,0
175_47,P,Okay That makes sense. Okay.,ack,,0.0,6
175_48,T,So that exception to confidentiality is really used in the most extreme cases of suicidal or homicidal ideation. Another exception in the state that will let you know about is if I have any reason to believe that a child or an elderly person is being abused. I have to report it was called a mandated reporter.,id,,0.0,0
175_49,P,Okay.,ack,,0.0,6
175_50,T,"Now I'm sure that you're not abusing anyone or elderly people. But I want to explain how this exception works because it's a little more far reaching you may think. So say that you come in and you discuss with me a neighbor, right, that seemingly has nothing to do with your treatment, but just kidding. I mentioned that something's going on that discussion leads me to believe that your neighbor's abusing their child. I still have to report that, even though it has really nothing to do with you directly. It's something you just told me in passing. I'd have to act on it. Again, I would only release the information necessary to protect a child safety. Does that make sense?",id, yq,0.0,0
175_51,P,It Does. Yes. ,yna,,0.0,5
175_52,T,"So no matter how I find out about it, or who it is, I have to act on that.",id,,0.0,0
175_53,P,Okay.,ack,,0.0,6
175_54,T,"And then the last exception I want to review is, again, as with many of these very unlikely, but if for some reason you're involved in any type of civil or criminal litigation, and a judge orders me to testify. I have to testify. I can tell you this happens. Very Rarely, but it can happen. And I can and will try not to disclose me, I'll ask the judge to not disclose if you don't want me to, but ultimately a judge can order me and I have to. So in the end, it's up to the judge. ",id,,0.0,0
175_55,P,Okay.,ack,,0.0,6
175_56,T,"So, again, most of these pretty unlikely, yeah. But I'd rather have all the information going forward so you don't have any concerns about where the information you're revealing or talking about where the information is going. Okay. Do you have any questions about that?",id,,0.0,0
175_57,P,seems pretty clear.,ack,,0.0,6
175_58,T,"Okay. Well, I appreciate you sitting through that. Talk on confidentiality. So we're gonna get started now with the assessment. ",gc,,0.0,3
175_59,P,Okay.,gc,,0.0,3
204_0,T,"Hi Miss Clark, My name is Alan Lime. I'm a social worker at the Family Health Center. Dr. Steele asked me if I would spend some time with you today. I'm really glad that you're here. I'm just curious as to why he would send you to me.",gt,irq,,2
204_1,P,"Well, I came to see Dr. Seal last week because of increasing stress and anxiety, that's kind of getting the best of me. And in the course of my appointment with him, he was asking how I was dealing with that stress. And I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent and maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and, and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something.",gt,id,,2
204_2,T,"Yeah. So he, he actually see me because you went to him for increased stress. And he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase And prior to prescribing anything, you want to make sure that you at least had someone to talk to that",gc,,,3
204_3,P,I suppose.,gc,,,3
204_4,T,Okay. So you filled in one of the Pink Sheets and I take a look at that.,irq,,,1
204_5,P,He told me to fill that out and bring it with me.,id,,,0
204_6,T,"Okay, thank you. So, you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week, you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well. And that you have one or two drinks in one setting ",irq,,,1
204_7,P,"typically, yeah. ",id,,,0
204_8,T,And maybe monthly you have more than that. What what's what kind of drinks do you have? What do you do when you typically drink,irq,,,1
204_9,P,"wine with my meals? You know, again, one or two, typically and more frequently, three or four. My stress is increased.",id,,,0
204_10,T,"So it's time to increase your strength a little more. Well, based on what you put here, you get it gives you six points on this scale scale ranging from zero to 46 points will put you in what we would consider an at risk zone. So if it's okay with you to talk a little bit about that,",id,,,0
204_11,P,okay,ack,,,6
204_12,T,"okay. So that was sunset run zero to 40. It's not a sort of super high risk, but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress might be some physical ailments related to alcohol as well could could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there, or even stay there. This is a typical standard drink size over here, I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine or not,",irq,,,1
204_13,P,I feel the glass up so maybe a little more than that,id,,,0
204_14,T,"maybe the little space it's upset, perhaps a drink drink and a half each one. So that also increased a little bit more. So perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here. And for women, healthy woman your age, no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be low or no risk and one seven in one week, seven total in total a week and what you say here is that even on this sheet, you're perhaps already drinking more than that. So what do you make of all that?",irq,,,1
204_15,P,"That news to me, you know, I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy. You know, no more than seven in a week? That seems kind of prohibitive?",id,,,0
204_16,T,"Yeah, it seems seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking or what you consider to be healthy drinking. And certainly there's there's conflicting information out there about what's healthy and what's not healthy. Imagine the increased stress work because we're concerned doctor seal as your stress increases, and if you were to describe you anything, maybe some interaction between the two, that would also be a concern for him. I would, I would think, so if you would, what is it that you like about alcohol?",irq,,,1
204_17,P,"Well, you know, it does, at least in the moment, temporarily reduce my stress. And I you know, like a good glass of wine. I don't don't drink the cheap stuff. I like the expensive.",id,,,0
204_18,T,"See, like the taste of it. And it does help to lower the stress, even if it's just for the fun of me drinking. What's not so good things about alcohol for you.",irq,,,1
204_19,P,"Um, well, you know, the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should I wake up feeling kinda yaak and, of course, part of my stress is finances. And I mentioned I like the good stuff. And so if I'm drinking more than I'm increasing my financial burden,",yna,cd,,5
204_20,T,your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking.,id,,,0
204_21,P,"Yeah, kind of defeating the purpose they're",gc,,,3
204_22,T," the drink introduce stress and increasing stress at the same time. So on the one hand, it low is it on the other hand, it's increasing kind of the seesaw teeter totter effect. What do you make of that, given that on one hand, it lowers on the other hand, it increases and and now it's increasing even more?",irq,,,1
204_23,P,And maybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress. Yeah.,id,,,0
204_24,T,Imagine investment thoughts so that what have you thought of trying?,irq,,,1
204_25,P,"Well, I've exercised in the past and that helps. Right now. My schedule is kind of out of whack and I just really don't know what to do. That's why I came to see Dr. seal. I thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help. You know, when I'm feeling overwhelmed,",id,,,0
204_26,T,"And he may be able to I'm not saying that he cannot just imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink, the level that you are drinking, that whatever he prescribes you, there may be an interaction with it to mention that he's concerned. I'm not completely sure. So you've had some success in the past of changing behaviors. And if you were to decide to make any changes here that sounds like you could draw upon that to make those changes. How important would it be for you on a scale of zero to 10? I have a low visual hero that if zero is not important, ten is very important to do something about your drinking wine.",irq,,,1
204_27,P,"Well, I mean, if if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking, then it's fairly important, maybe about seven. ",id,,,0
204_28,T,It's it's pretty up there. What do you choose a seven out of five or four?,irq,,,1
204_29,P,"Well, again, I got to get things under control. You know, My kids are dependent on me and I've got to go to work to help ease this financial stress. And so, you know, all those responsibilities",id,,,0
204_30,T,there's a lot riding on your decision on what to do with this. What if anything would bring up to an eight or nine on that scale?,irq,,,1
204_31,P,"Well, the you know, the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction, I certainly can't afford to, you know, have any more stress.  So, yeah, ",id,,,0
204_32,T,so so you you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it. And if lowering your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do.,ynq,,,4
204_33,P,hmmm,ack,,,6
204_34,T,How confident are you that you could do something about your drinking?,irq,,,1
204_35,P,"I'm pretty confident and you know, probably about a seven or an eight ",id,,,0
204_36,T,"Okay, so it's pretty high up there again, and what if, what if anything, would you choose to do would it be to cut down would it be to quit? I'm just curious about that",irq,,,1
204_37,P,"I you know, I like a lot A glass of wine, I don't want to quit altogether, I'd be willing to try cutting that. But now if it's going to, if Dr. Seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety, and it meant that I had to not drink at all, I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time.",id,,,0
204_38,T,"So you'd be willing to stop altogether. That's what was indicated by the physician. Okay. So based on that, how ready are you to do anything right now, whether it's to cut back whether it's to quit?",irq,,,1
204_39,P,"Well, again, you know, if if I can get something to help me manage if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress, then then you know, I be pretty ready. Again, maybe about an on that scale, maybe an eight.",id,,,0
204_40,T,"Okay, so that's, that's pretty hot there as well. It sounds as though you're pretty motivated to do something about this right now, given any responsibilities given your children learning at this point. And just on lowering anxiety, in general, it sounds and that's one of your goals as well. Well, I'm pretty confident Once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do, you'll be able to follow through with it. Based on your experience in the past of making behavior changes. I mentioned some things that you can draw upon. What's one thing that you could do? Imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress.",irq,,,1
204_41,P,"Oh, I you know that the exercise but again, that's that's kind of difficult to fit in right now. I'm hoping that Dr. Seal will prescribe something for me to take when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of ",id,,,0
204_42,T,"one of the things we can offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this this area of your life, this area of increased stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make an appointment for you for like before you leave today to talk to somebody",id,,,0
204_43,P,That would be nice,ack,,,6
204_44,T,"that also has some information here if you're interested, some pamphlet on alcohol and and how what helps limits on how it may be affected by medications that you take as well. And I wish you lots of luck. It sounds as though you're really committed to making this shift in this change. And I imagine doctors still want to follow up with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks.",id,,,0
204_45,P,Okay,ack,,,6
204_46,T,"Again, I look forward to speaking to you in the future.",gt,,,2
204_47,P,"All right, thank you very much.",gt,,,2
206_0,T,"Yeah, okay. All right. What was your relationship with your teachers? And maybe those that some of the peers that you had at the school? I mean, was there any?",irq,,,1
206_1,P,"No, I usually I've been dealing with the teachers. Honestly, I was always the class clown. So I'm usually getting kicked out, getting detention, you know, so I didn't really get along with the teachers trying to teach class right stuff. ",id,,,0
206_2,T,Okay. So overall today are you pursuing or do you want to further your education,irq,,,1

206_34,T,"right maybe that's something we can discuss to help you find the cadet program close fine. We're able to give you a, you know, some goals to set to get you in the program at that. But let's look at you know, back, let's back up a little bit to the marijuana. Because you and I know being in law enforcement, you know, marijuana and being a cop, pretty much ",gc,,,3
206_35,P,"Yeah, yeah. ",ack,,,6
206_36,T,And you would have to what would you have to do?,irq,,,1
206_37,P,"Let it go, I have to let it go. ",id,,,0
206_38,T,"So, what we want to do while you're here, you know, we want to help you here develop a treatment plan and treatment model where you can pursue some realistic goals. We want to set some goals for you. Also, what about your medical History tongue a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been in the hospital? Has anything ever happened to a broken bone",irq,,,1
206_39,P,I had surgery on my cybereason,id,,,0
206_40,T,"What about in your family? Is there any diseases in your family and you want to know suffer for any illnesses, ailments. Okay. And as far as medical attention is there anyone that needs medical that needed medical attention in the past maybe someone on meds in your family psychological health? Was there anyone maybe that has gone to therapy that has been in therapy Your family and family member",irq,,,1
206_41,P,No.,yna,,,5
206_42,T,"And what we want to do, what I want to do to help you with this verse is one want to develop a treatment plan to help you with the marijuana use. We want to be able to look at your support system, you know who's in your life right now? What are your friends that you smoke marijuana with? What type of people are they? Would this be a good fit for you? But our whole goal is to start you off with small steps. So today, you're using marijuana how many times a day. So you pretty much said you use it every day. ",ynq,,,4
206_43,P,Yeah.,ack,,,6
206_44,T,But how many times?,irq,,,1
206_45,P,3-4 times,id,,,0
206_46,T,Do you wake up and you do?,irq,,,1
206_47,P,"yeah. It's not my morning routine. Go ahead and do it. And then usually around noon time I'll do it again and then towards five o'clock. I'll do it again at nighttime in Fargo. They'll do Again, right",id,,,0
206_48,T,so one of maybe one of the realistic goals is you're okay you know we can we can narrow down maybe the relationship see which of your friends right now today? How many of them smoke,irq,,,1
206_49,P,about six seven,id,,,0
206_50,T,Yeah so maybe a realistic short term goal is to begin to see which friends to hang out with you know and then also your mom man either way she,gc,,,3
206_51,P,"She told me before you fall into the wrong crowd and fall into something just she pretty much said that this if I keep this up is gonna get me into something I don't want to get into right now jail time round because we makes you do things that you shouldn't be doing for other things legal, right so,",gc,,,3
206_52,T,"so definitely we want to look at your whole peer relationships who your friends are We also want to look at your your time right now. So, you mentioned earlier that you were working. Are you working today? ",ynq,id,,4
206_53,P,No.,yna,,,5
206_54,T,"Okay, so maybe that's another thing a realistic goal that we need to look at, and maybe help you pursue is it as a job? Maybe because the idle time sometimes can trigger events, you know, where you begin to want to use marijuana, and then we can identify some of the emotions that you're feeling. Let's go over that maybe briefly.

75_47,P,now? It definitely like dissipates once I can like go sit down.,yna,,,5
75_48,T,"Okay, so so the sort of next big drop off for symptoms would be when you're done with  the presentation",irq,,,1
75_49,P,"Yeah, when eyes are maybe no longer on me. They've moved on to somebody else. So I figured like, okay, they forgot about me. I'm safe.",id,,,0
